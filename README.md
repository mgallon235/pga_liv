## Project Overview
The project aims to scrape data from golf-related websites, preprocess the text data, and apply machine learning models to make predictions. Key tasks include:
- Scraping data from player profiles and press conferences
- Cleaning and preprocessing text data
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Building predictive models


## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mgallon235/pga_liv.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd pga_liv
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. **Data Scraping:**
   - Run `Golf_Scrapper.ipynb` to scrape data from the specified sources.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Use `Preprocessor.ipynb` to clean and preprocess the scraped data.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
   - Explore the data using `Cleaning_EDA.ipynb`.

4. **Model Building and Prediction:**
   - Build and evaluate prediction models using `Predictions.ipynb` and `Txt_Mining.ipynb`.
