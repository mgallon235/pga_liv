rory mcilroy,0,2024-02,2024,111,1,0,1,third start this season had a chance to play pebble and genesis can you share where you game is and what are you looking forward to this week,yeah so third start on the pga tour i had two events in the middle east and played well in dubai i feel like pebble the weather disrupted it and the courses were super soft won the pro am portion so i guess it wasn't all bad and then riv was pretty good i made a mess of and on the first day but apart from that i felt like i played some pretty good golf feel like my game is in pretty good shape you know it's nice to stay at home this week and feel a little more i guess relaxed in the surroundings looking forward to getting started,0
rory mcilroy,0,2024-02,2024,7,0,1,1,he started by saying there is a good chance you would go to liv it was is there a percentage that,somewhere in the middle maybe who knows,0
rory mcilroy,0,2024-01,2024,6,0,1,1,but do you think that it's also reflective of your attitude in this debate the fact that there say feeling that bbc you've got to be really good investigator to find live golf these days,just buy sky sports i guess,0
rory mcilroy,0,2024-01,2024,129,1,0,1,i can't help asking about asia this year probably the dp world tour has one much its strongest asian swings with some of the elite golfers there from the dp world tour or maybe even the pga coming there would help the sport in that part of the world which is obviously the most populated,absolutely i spoke to dr munjal on the course about it today you know if this global tour somehow comes to fruition in the next few years could you imagine bringing the best or golfers in the world to india for a tournament or you know that that would change i think would change the game and the perception of the game in a country like that so again there's so much opportunity out there to go global with it and i've said this for the last few months but golf is at an inflection point and if golf doesn't do it now i fear that it will never do it and we'll sort of have this fractured landscape forever as i said i hope it all works out,0
rory mcilroy,0,2024-01,2024,146,0,1,1,you have that wonderful privilege of going back to golf courses you've won on quite a lot in your career a testament to what you have won does this one have a any extra significance because it was the start of the journey,yeah it was obviously the first win of my professional career but i first played this event as an amateur in so i've been coming here for years i can't even believe it but dubai has meant a lot to me over my career i got my first win here i feel like it's a tournament to give me one of my first opportunities to play on this tour my first sponsor was from here jumeirah so i have a lot of great memories and i have a lot of great friends in this region i lived here for four years as well there's a big piece of my life has been spent here in dubai and i'm always excited to get back i don't spend as much time here as i used to it's always exciting to come back and spend a couple of weeks,0
rory mcilroy,0,2024-01,2024,155,1,0,1,you've talked openly about your quest for more major championships decorated across regular events dp world tour on the pga tour do regular events still quench your thirst or do you desire so greatly majors,they still quench my thirst there would be no reason to tee up in these events if they didn't winning is winning and competing is competing and it doesn't matter whether it's the dubai desert classic over here or whether it's the honda classic or whatever it is i love competing i love to try to win golf tournaments and you know majors are really really important in this game but it's not the only thing that matters in my mind and there are other things but look the majors are important and i would love to get my hands on another one and i think mostly because i have done everything else there is to do in the game since i last won a major championship so to me it's like the last step on this journey that i've been on this last few years is just getting my hands on another major trophy,0
rory mcilroy,0,2024-01,2024,159,1,1,1,last week mcilroy fleetwood huge numbers across the global player in terms of viewership attention clearly on the dp world tour here last year a showdown where you got up on patrick reed to win here again at the hero dubai desert classic where world golf is competing for attention right now we know there's the effort for liv golf the pif to be a part of it in the future going forward with the dp world tour and the pga tour is there a continue for you at all where this tournament might sit if there is a triumvirate at the top of it all,so not particularly because i think the way i view it is a bit like champions league in football it's like the best of the best in europe and then all of the other leagues feed up into it all these players and there are there's lots of different tours getting interest and a lot of great players but if you want to create something that is real value for the game of golf i think it's this top level tour and then all the other tours feed into it that's my and there's promotion and relegation and you have to earn your way in and you have to earn your spot to stay in as well i think that's really important too i think it has to be global in nature and to me you need to figure out a structure where all these other tours feed into that so it gives people a chance to come up,0
rory mcilroy,0,2024-01,2024,244,0,1,1,since we last spoke jon rahm has joined liv the talks have been extended to april to try to resolve the fractures in our game you were saying yesterday your dream scenario is if tournament world tour with a truly global schedule tell us which tournaments you think should be involved in that,i think informally we sort of have most of that global schedule anyway if you look at what all the tournaments that all the top players play informally sort of without any structure without it between a few different tours i think we have at least the majority of what a global tour would look like we still need to make sure that the biggest tournaments are in america obviously that's the biggest place that we play but also trying to elevate some of the other tournaments around the world you know trying to middle east continental europe u k and ireland the far east whether it be japan korea singapore hong kong australia south africa i mean you've got a lot of different opportunities there i think if we really want to if everyone is talking about growing the game and trying to especially if these investors are going to come into our game and they want a return on their capital i think everyone needs to start thinking more globally around it but globally in a holistic way but not really like this tour that tour and another tour like okay what is the best what is the best structure for elite professional golf the top to guys in the world and what would that look like especially if the game is going to look different going forward and everything is on the table i just think it's worth having that conversation,0
rory mcilroy,0,2024-01,2024,119,1,0,1,you said with the proviso in mind that corporate america must be involved why is that so important to you,because they have the most money basically you know they have proved over the last the pga tour has proved over the last or years that corporate america is interested in the game of golf for a number of different reasons and america is still a huge market for our game because america has become such a huge market it's maybe not let other markets around the world thrive as well and if we can sort of all start to work together a little bit more i think a rising tide lists all ships or all boats and that's the mindset that i would i guess come to that thinking of what the best thing is for professional golf,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-11,2023,113,1,0,1,you made the decision to resign from the pga tour policy board can you give us your thinking behind that decision,yeah i just think i've got a lot going on in my life between my golf game my family and my growing investment portfolio my involvement in tgl and i just felt like something had to give i just didn't feel like i could commit the time and the energy into doing that i don't mind being busy but i just like being busy doing my own stuff something had to give and there's guys that are on that board that are spending a lot more time and a lot more energy on it than i am it's in good hands and i felt like it was the right time to step off,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-11,2023,185,1,1,1,and do you expect clarity because at the moment the waters are seriously muddy aren't they,it's a formalising of the pathway that's always sort of been there i got into the top in the world at the end of and in i was going to start in the middle east and then i was going to the states and play the match play the honda the whatever else it's always been there it's just a bit more official but at the same time you know the reason that the european tour started with as to give professional golfers opportunities to play golf tournaments and earn a living so if you look at what the mission statement is for the dp world tour it's to give professional golfers opportunities to play their sport make a living and there's no better place to have opportunity and to make a living than what's going on on the pga tour so i don't see that side of the argument at all for golfers playing on the european tour i think it's an amazing thing that's happened and as i said is formalizes a pathway to get to the very top level of professional golf,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-11,2023,13,1,0,1,pga tour card being handed out there's been some outside noise about it's not been a good thing for the dp world tour that we are losing ten stars do you see it just as a sort of progression of the natural migration that happened in previous years when players went to the us,i didn't see it as a sacrifice i see it as an opportunity,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-11,2023,103,1,0,1,we've got the scottish open as a co sanctioned event but would you like to see more co sanctioned events between the dp world tour and the pga tour i always thought the middle east cohost won whether it be dubai or elsewhere is that something you would like to see in the future,yeah i would say that's right i think getting something done sooner rather than later is a good thing because you know even if we get a deal done it doesn't mean that it's actually going to happen that's up to the united states government at that point and whether the department of justice think that it's the right thing to do or whether anti competitive or whatever even if a deal does get done it's not a sure thing so yeah we are just going to have to wait and see but in my opinion the faster something gets done the better,0
jon rahm,1,2023-10,2023,232,0,1,1,the scenes on the last few holes were you aware of the situation what were your emotions when your tee shot on hit the green and rickie conceded the putt,obviously i don't have as much experience in ryder cups as rosey and rory have but i think they mailed it it's the ability to walk through those gates and those doors and forget about who you are outside of this week what you have done or what you may do afterwards really truly doesn't matter in my case obviously the spaniards have a legacy to live up to it's certainly not easy right the three main figures before me seve ollie and sergio are three guys that if i'm not mistaken all three of them have earned points in the ryder cup three out of nine are spanish so it's a lot to live up to and it's something that really inspires me especially when josé is around right he always tells me little things to inspire me in that sense so following in their footsteps and how they try to make the team better is the way i've approached it as well i try to do my part in the team room but i think rory said it best is the fact that we can go in there and make fun of each other and nobody really cares right we all laugh and that's about it i mean you need to be able to make fun of yourself and it's a truly humbling experience to be part of this team,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-09,2023,155,0,1,1,MODERATOR,with some of them some of them i do and some live in live in different places and it's hard and then the weeks of tournaments are always so busy and we are always doing our own things and have our own little teams around us and it's hard to carve out that time i feel like leading up to ryder cups it's always a bit easier irish open and wentworth the last couple of weeks spending more time with guys and making that a priority has been there but yeah during the course of the year i'm just as close with a lot of the american guys as i am with the europeans just because of the places i play and where i live and who i practise with and who i play with at home but these last few weeks have been really nice to sort of reconnect with some of those guys,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-09,2023,100,1,0,1,how much quality time do you get to spend with the guys on your team on the pga tour or dp world tour do you go for dinner or get to have long extended quality time with these guys or not really,no because i think that's all part of the ryder cup there's not a lot of other instances in the game of golf where that happens but there's certainly a line most fans that come out to watch golf are very respectful and they know what that line is no i have no issues about that yeah we have all had our fair share of heckles over the years and whatever and that's the a part of it someone said to me once if you want to be part of the circus you have to put up with the clowns,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-09,2023,10,0,1,1,a lot of water under the bridge in the last couple years but in this week of all weeks do you actually miss guys like sergio poulter westwood,i live in florida so i'm all right with heat,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-09,2023,59,0,1,1,did he live up to your expectations,probably exceeded them everyone talks about what a great driver of the golf ball he is and which he is the ball striking is incredible but i was really impressed with his wedge play and how he can sort of control his trajectory with shorter clubs i was on the bandwagon before certainly at the front of it now,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-09,2023,178,0,1,1,your own game coming into this week how big is it to sharpen their game this week,yeah i mean again even though you know we are trying to create this really good team environment at the end of the day we are individual sports people we all need to do what's best for us to get ourselves ready to play in rome yeah i feel like that we have this week it's nice to be able to stay short putt some of the guys from the states the last competitive guys they will have played is the tour championship a couple weeks ago but there's also some guys on the team that will i think play napa is it this week and then i know brooks is obviously playing the week before in a liv event there's some guys that are going to have i guess a bit more sharpness coming in the build up to ryder cup week is so long anyway get there on a monday and you've got that extra day you're not playing until friday i'm pretty sure everyone on both teams will feel ready to go on friday morning,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-09,2023,195,0,1,1,you've played under a few captains now i just wonder how your relationship with luke compares to others and given you're a senior figure is your relationship with the captain different has that evolved do you feel he is leaning on you,actually not really i think he's sort of let me be a little bit we've played a lot of golf and trying to play well look we have chats we live on the same street in florida we live ten houses down from each other so it's not as if we don't see each other all the time but it's just been on a more casual sort of basis it has not been sit down talks and strategies and pairings that's not my that's not my job i don't want to have that role i'm one of his players and i just want to do my best for the team but like if there's anything asked of me by being a leading player a veteran player a player that's played in quite a few of them i'm certainly happy to take direction and do what's needed of me but i don't feel like it's my place to give the captain my opinion unless it's asked for and luke i think has got a lot of great vice captains around him and has leant on a couple of past captains as well which has been great,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-09,2023,65,0,1,1,out early at but the irish crowds out in great force describe the support you get from the irish crowds here in the dublin area,it's fantastic no matter where we play the irish open the crowds always come out it's a pleasure to play in front of them because they are very knowledgeable and they are very enthusiastic i feel like they live and die every shot with you whether you hole a putt or miss a putt but it's great to have that support out there for sure,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-09,2023,194,1,0,1,what do you make of the team in the end pádraig was in here yesterday he was pretty bullish about the team saying maybe we're back to where we were in the ' s with sort of the top players in the world on the team,yeah i would have to agree with that you look at viktor end of the season with what jon rahm as has done this year myself tommy fleetwood back to playing some of the best golf he's played in a while tyrrell shane rosey i think you've got a nice blend of experience and youth in the team i think everyone that everyone who has followed golf over the last few months has known the potential that someone like ludvig has had you just have to watch him hit balls on the range at a pga tour event i mean he's special he really is he's an unbelievable ball striker i don't think people maybe from this part of the world recognised it because he's played all of his golf in college and in the states and then played a lot of pga tour stuff but he came over here and finished fourth in czech republic and won in switzerland he proved to a lot of people that he's worthy of a pick i honestly think luke was going to pick him regardless but he obviously his job easier when he won on sunday,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-08,2023,147,1,0,1,we saw you out there yesterday on the putting green it looked like maybe you had gone back to the spider putter do you know what you're going to have in the bag for the putter this week,yeah maybe less emotionally involved i last year it was to do with how can we make the product of the pga tour better and i think i was really invested in that so when it comes to like governance and investment and all that like that doesn't really not that i don't care about it but it doesn't excite me as much as making the product better and how can we make this the most competitive landscape to play professional golf and how can we get all the best players to play together like that's the stuff that excites me the stuff that's going on right now look i'm on the board and i have to be involved and whenever something's brought to the table i'll vote on it yes or no but yeah maybe just not as emotionally engaged on all of this other stuff,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-08,2023,11,0,1,1,just looking ahead to the ryder cup just out of curiosity do you have a problem with the americans being able to select liv guys and europe's not or it is what it is,no i don't think it would make a difference for us,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-08,2023,118,0,1,1,for the ryder cup the ryder cup being able to take guys from liv the americans taking liv guys and europe not,it depends what you value i think scottie's won twice this year jon's won four times jon's won the masters scottie's won the players if you go on total wins it's hard because how can you not it's going to be really difficult because scottie's had he could end up with the best ball striking season of all time he's hit the ball as good if not better than tiger hit it in which is the benchmark for all of us but i think jon probably has a little more to show for his year but i think it could come down to this week and who performs but it's a two horse race between jon and scottie,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-08,2023,352,1,0,1,do you have a thought on who the player of the year should be right now and how could that change over the next four days,so this happened to me this year at oak hill i mean i think when you play as much golf as we do your subconscious knows what shots you can hit and what shots you can't and i was over my second shot at oak hill on on sunday not really like didn't have a chance to win the golf tournament i was in the top but i mean whether i made birdie or not on that hole it wasn't really going to make a difference the pin was on left side of the green and i just sensed myself aiming further and further right as i got over the ball so i just couldn't trust that i could hit the shot that i wanted to hit and when i got in after that i was like i need to do something here because i'm not able to hit if i can't hit a shot under basically zero pressure to a left pin how am i expected to do it when so that was really just that's when it's like this is purely technique i need to go and work on some stuff i think the little bit of work that i did around like after pga before that memorial canada u s open travelers stretch like that really helped me go on to play some really basically after that even though i played okay at oak hill i wasn't terribly comfortable but i went on a really consistent run after then and just that little just that little bit of like self reflection and being like yeah that wasn't a good feeling and knowing that okay i need to get my i need to work on my technique a little bit so that i can trust what i'm doing a bit more i think it always comes back to that like you can make some equipment changes to try to freshen it up or try to just get a different look but for the most part it's the person at the end of the club swinging it that's usually the problem,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-08,2023,72,1,0,1,the format this week it seems like it's close to being as good as it can be all things considered is there any way it could be improved going forward do you think,well it needs to be both but again going back to my previous comments of the pga tour as a product and being able to create an entertaining finale that has some drama and has a lot of high stakes i would say both like the players have to feel it's fair as well but if i'm thinking big picture i would say entertainment has to be a big part of it,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-08,2023,297,0,1,1,if it were addressed going forward what would be more important entertainment or fairness,so yeah i think you know i was i feel like once everything sort of got up and running with the innovation lab and making sure that all the technology is humming along and working together i get probably weekly updates on it but i wouldn't say that i'm hugely i think i'll become a lot more involved once we're able to get into the arena start testing the stuff start to try to figure out all the little glitches that are bound to happen before the start in january so i would say at this point it's been about trying to sell the team franchises and that's been going really well and there's been a lot of interest created trying to fill the rosters trying to get people on board and that you know that's not my job that's the ceo and the guys behind the scenes but i think sort of post ryder cup and once we're able to get into the arena in october time i think i'll become a lot more involved and just making sure everything's sorts of set up the right way and then approach wise i think you can have a little more fun with it you can be aggressive yeah it's going to be a more lively atmosphere we're going to be mic'd up we're going to be able to maybe say some stuff there that we wouldn't necessarily say out here so i'm looking forward to it it's going to be a different format it's going to be hopefully entertaining for fans and exciting to watch maybe some formats that people haven't seen before so it's going to be cool it's going to be interesting a little more of a team element which i think will be cool,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-08,2023,126,1,0,1,we're not that far off from the launch of the tgl just curious how involved are you week to week day to day in preparing for that and then how will you approach competing in one of those events compared to how you approach competing at a regular tour event,i don't think all the player directors have to be unanimous i don't think it has to be a unanimous vote it just has to be a majority and i think tiger being on the board you know he's i think it's meaningful that he's on it that he's engaged he's certainly been spending more time on it than i have he's been talking to some people he's been talking to a lot of people he's really engaged in just trying to get the best outcome for the players on the pga tour so i think his difference has been felt already i think it will only continue to his presence on there will only continue to grow as we head towards that december st deadline,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-08,2023,65,1,0,1,just a couple of comments on viktor who you played with today,amazing yeah looks like he's going to win after scottie's bogey there yeah absolutely amazing golf amazing playing look he's had some great wins already this year had a great chance at the pga championship didn't quite get it done but yeah he's a world class player and looking forward to him being on my team for the ryder cup in a few weeks' time,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-08,2023,101,1,0,1,sometimes i ask you questions and i really don't know how you're going to answer and this is one of them i think you should be pleased with the week you're not going to win but a top finish you have to really be looking forward to two more playoff events,absolutely yeah yeah my game is in really good shape i think tee to green this is just a continuation of what i've been seeing over the past couple of months ever since really that like pga championship all the way through to here ball striking wise tee to green it's been really good i started to hole a few more putts on the weekend here and got myself up the leaderboard yeah with two playoff events to go i'm certainly happy with the start i wish i could have been a couple better but nothing but confidence going into chicago,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-08,2023,141,1,0,1,is a pretty solid day out here i know that there's a bit of frustration as well just describe some of the emotions coming off the golf course,yeah i guess sort of it feels like a week of what could have been yeah look again everyone in this field could think about the shots that they could have saved over the course of the four days but i just think with how good my game has felt from tee to green i could have maybe taken more advantage of that over the last few days but still it's another really solid tournament if anything it's just it's another i guess block in the wall in terms of like building the confidence and from where my confidence was at the pga championship in may to where it is now it's completely different i've been on a nice little run and yeah if i i sort of have to keep it in perspective and i'm feeling really good about everything,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-08,2023,112,1,0,1,to go to monday's announcement of the schedule i know it's really early in the process but have you looked at what your schedule might look like next year based on the changes and what are your thoughts on the flow of what they came up with for next year,yeah so there's a lot that i like with this schedule next year i love quail hollow going straight into pga i love memorial going straight into u s open i think for me anyway the run up to augusta is a little i don't know what i'm going to play there if at all maybe play san antonio the week before but i'd say my schedule will look pretty much the same as it did this year i'll most likely i'm not a huge hawai'i guy so i'll probably not go to hawai'i but i'll play pebble beach and sort of play a similar schedule from there on that i've played,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-07,2023,118,1,0,1,your th win on the pga tour th on the dp world tour championship and your first on scottish soil how gutsy were those closing birdies for you on and when you think of gutsy performances in your career,this is right up there with the best of them especially after missing the short birdie putt on i thought if i can birdie one of the last two and get into a playoff that would be a bonus to finish in these conditions the two iron shots that i hit the iron into and the iron into the last are probably two of the best shots i've hit all year and then to finish them off with the putts as well yeah it feels absolutely amazing i've had a few close calls recently so to get over the line and get this bit of confidence going into next week and the rest of the season is huge,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-07,2023,137,0,1,1,you had to wait to take that putt on what was going through your mind,i was just trying to take the scene in everyone around the green you know i get to do this not for a living but i get to do this to try to fulfill my boyhood dreams i guess so to be on the green in that environment and the more that you can try to smell the roses along the way so that's what i was trying to do i was just trying to take in the scene and do anything to not think about the putt that i was going to try to hit i knew what it was i didn't need to over think it it was a straight downwind putt so i just needed to get it started on line and gravity and the wind and conditions will take care of the rest,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-07,2023,97,1,0,1,the week before your last major win the us pga you obviously won bridgestone you've obviously now won again heading to hoylake how much of a boost is it heading down the road,yeah it is it's nice to have the validation the validation it's great racking up top s top s but it's much nicer heading away with a trophy on sunday afternoon it's a great shot of confidence again going back to that little nugget about the australian open in having something fresh in my memory if i hopefully find myself in a similar position next week where i've got a chance to win with nine holes to go i can certainly draw on what i did here today that i can get myself in the mix again,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-07,2023,99,0,1,1,heading back to hoylake next week how does it feel going back being defending champion on that course and how valuable to play this week before going there,yeah very excited i've only been back to i think one major venue that i've won season since which was kiawah back a couple years ago yeah every time i see this it gives me goosebumps yeah it will be really cool it will be really cool to go back there so i think playing links golf this week as well definitely just helps me get acclimatised to conditions and the grass type and everything else there's a lot of golf to be played before going down to liverpool and i want to play well the next three days,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-07,2023,153,1,0,1,i don't think you played in this last year as a warmup to the open what's your decision as to why you're playing in it now and how are you feeling ahead of what's going to be as ever a huge two weeks,last year we had the jp mcmanus pro am so i felt like even though it wasn't completely competitive and serious i felt like i guess easing my way back into competitive golf before the open at st andrews so i just felt like this year coming off the back of a big stretch having three weeks off going into the open probably wasn't going to be the ideal prep so to get some competitive golf under my belt going into hoylake but also it's now a co sanctioned event with pga tour european tour leading the race to dubai up there in the fedexcup it's also an opportunity to gain some points on both sides of the pond looking towards the end of the year and trying to win the season long titles on both sides again i feel like i'm sort of killing a few birds with one stone this week,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-06,2023,45,0,1,1,assuming you take the next couple weeks after this off before heading over and getting ready to play to liverpool how are your energy levels at this point played a lot and a lot of things going on,i actually feel okay you know i think two days at home in between la and here was nice to not really do anything yeah i actually for my fourth week in a row feel okay which is a pleasant surprise fastscripts by asap sports,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-06,2023,102,1,0,1,rory talk us through your first ace on the pga tour,yeah iron to yards slightly back into the wind off the right and yeah as hole in ones go i've had them in the past where it has been like an okay shot and you get a little lucky that was the best shot of the day that i hit obviously a bonus for it to go in the hole but it was really cool i played pretty averagely up until that point felt like that hole in one got me going a little bit birdied the next couple holes after that and sort of got me into the tournament a bit,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-06,2023,29,0,1,1,when does the countdown to royal liverpool start,three minutes ago i guess yeah i'll play travelers next week i'll play the scottish open but i'm focused on making sure that i'm ready to go for liverpool,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-06,2023,52,0,1,1,you've won majors before you've won this tournament before you spoke recently about how you're watching back your triumph at royal liverpool golf club what boost does that give you that know how that savvy of winning the sport's biggest prize going into tomorrow,i don't know it's been such a long time since i've done it i'm going out there to try to execute a game plan and i feel like over the last three days i've executed that game plan really really well and i just need to do that for one more day,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-06,2023,73,1,0,1,the events of the past week have they perhaps concerned you that you put your faith in maybe an altruistic version of the pga tour that doesn't exist at least maybe not anymore and maybe you need to look after yourself a little more,yeah i'm not that i wouldn't say i viewed the pga tour as through that altruism lens per se i mean at the end of the day this is business and my job is playing golf at the end of the day so the more that i can focus on that and focus on the birdies and the bogeys instead of the stuff that's happened in the board room i'll be much happier,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-06,2023,251,1,1,1,yesterday's news i guess how and where were you when you received it and how did it make you feel,yeah so i think the one thing that i think was really misconstrued last yesterday was all the headlines were pga tour merges with liv and liv's got nothing to do with this right it's the pga tour dp world tour and the public investment fund are basically partnering to create a new company this has gotten i think that's where i was a little frustrated because all i've wanted to do and all i've wanted in the past year from basically this tournament is to protect the future of the pga tour and protect the aspirational nature of what the pga tour stands for and i hope that this does that but i think with the headlines being merges with liv like that's not the i mean if you look at the structure of how it's structured now this new company sits above everything jay's the ceo of that so technically anyone that is involved with liv now would answer to jay so the pga tour have control of everything and one thing as well is whether you like it or not the pif were going to keep spending the money in golf at least the pga tour now controls how that money is spent so you know if you're thinking about one of the biggest sovereign wealth funds in the world would you rather have them as a partner or an enemy at the end of the day money talks and you would rather have them as a partner,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-06,2023,181,1,0,1,given that the doj was already looking into the pga tour for antitrust violations and all of that how much of an uphill battle do you think this is going to be to push this through going forward now now that the two sides have kind of come together and are operating together here,i mean i feel bad for rbc and the canadian open to think about what went on this time last year and then the bombshell that was dropped i mean rbc have been one of the biggest supporters of the pga tour over the last years this year they're supporting a designated event at hilton head they're sponsoring their national open they're pouring tens of millions of dollars into the pga tour that the players obviously benefit from so i really i feel bad because being such a great partner and having this stuff sort of dropped on you two years in a row is very unfair as to what it looks like going forward i would like to say that things don't change i would like to think that the canadian open keeps on thriving and just like every other event on the pga tour and i think the pga tour are hopefully going to announce their schedule here in the next three or four weeks and i don't think that will you know i don't expect that to change,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-06,2023,220,1,0,1,i know it's early but how does an announcement like this impact tournaments like the canadian open for example one of the storied events on the pga tour,i do and look i've dealt with jay a lot closer than a lot of those guys have from where we were a couple of weeks ago to where we are today i think the future of the pga tour looks brighter as a whole as an entity what that looks like for individual players in terms of keeping a tour card and bringing players back into the fold and then that sacrifices other people that's where the anger comes from right and i understand that there still has to be consequences to actions the people that left the pga tour irreparably harmed this tour started litigation against it like we can't just welcome them back in like that's not going to happen and i think that was the one thing that jay was trying to get across yesterday is like guys we're not just going to bring these guys back in and pretend like nothing's happened that is not going to happen so i do have confidence in him i think you ask the people around him that deal with him in a business sense whether it's the directors of the board of the pga tour or the title sponsors that he deals with i mean he seems to be a very impressive individual when it comes to business,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-06,2023,6,1,0,1,we heard there was a lot of anger in the clubhouse yesterday in the meeting yesterday with the commissioner do you still have confidence in jay monahan as commissioner of the pga,i was never offered any money,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-06,2023,108,0,1,1,i know you and many other golfers were offered substantial amounts of money to join liv,i mean the simple answer is yes the complex answer is how does that happen right and that's all that's all a gray area and up in the air at the minute but yeah there is it's hard to it's hard for me to not sit up here and feel somewhat like a sacrificial lamb and feeling like i've put myself out there and this is what happens again removing myself from the situation i see how this is better for the game of golf there's no denying that but for me as an individual yeah i there's just going to have to be conversations that are had,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-06,2023,155,1,1,1,oh my apologies should the golfers who maybe stayed loyal and turned down liv should they be made whole financially,so i think yasir is very so the pga tour already is doing their own sort of team thing right we're going to do tgl which is it's not on a golf course but it's a team type of event and it's an entertainment product and that stuff was already starting to happen but it was very so you had like proper competitive golf like we're playing this week and you have more entertainment type of golf that you get more into the team atmosphere and you bring tech into it and it's a more made for tv type of deal i would say an element of team golf might still stay it certainly in my opinion and my hope is it won't it won't be under the liv umbrella it's something that the pga tour will control the pga tour will operate and it will hopefully look very different to what liv has been,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-06,2023,71,1,1,1,you mentioned that this has really nothing to do with liv golf but do you foresee you and other pga tour players having to play some sort of team events moving forward into the fall or a series of them,yesterday was tough i think the shock of it the surprise of it i wasn't looking forward to this to be honest with you but once we all get done here and you write your stories and say what you say what i say or quote me or whatever it is i'm going to go to the range and do some practice and try to get ready for a golf tournament,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-06,2023,136,1,1,1,how much of a distraction is this as you try to go and win this tournament three times in a row,but it's not liv i think that's the thing i still hate liv like i hate liv like i hope it goes away and i would fully expect that it does and i think that's where the distinction here is this is the pga tour the dp world tour and the pif very different from liv all i've tried to do is protect what the pga tour is and what the pga tour stands for and i think it will continue to do that so look going forward i hope that there's you know there may be a team element and you're going to see maybe me maybe whoever else play in some sort of team golf but i don't think it will look anything like liv has looked and i think that's a good thing,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-06,2023,129,1,1,1,a lot of fans are upset at this news the war of words between the pga tour and liv got very heated and fans got very involved what do you say to fans who are disappointed in this deal,of course i said it to jay yesterday you've galvanized everyone against something and that thing that you galvanized everyone against you've now partnered with so yeah of course i understand it it is hypocritical it sounds hypocritical the one thing i would say is again whether you like it or not the pif and the saudis want to spend money in the game of golf it is they want to do this and they weren't going to stop so how can you know the thing for me and this is the one thing that i've always thought about how can we get that money into the game but use it the right way and i think that's what this ultimately will do hopefully i mean that's my hope,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-06,2023,1,0,1,1,just as a follow up i mean you do see why fans are upset though i see what you're saying that it's not liv it's the pif but nonetheless during this back and forth over the past year at one point jay monahan said a deal like this would never happen out of respect for the victims of obviously you're not responsible for what mr monahan says but you can see why this has stirred up a lot emotions in fans right,yeah,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-06,2023,149,1,0,1,welcome to canada how are you able to sort of quell a lot of the noise that comes around you you played great through three rounds at the pga championship such a hard course memorial in a perfect spot such a hard course but any time you don't win the perception is like rory let down but you're tackling these really difficult layouts and you're putting yourself in a perfect spot on that note we have a u s open next week how familiar on that course and did you get a chance to talk to jack yet because we picked up on the mic when you walked off at memorial he said he wanted to sort of have a sit down,yeah look it was heated people were surprised people felt like they were in the dark about all this look most of the gripes come from the guys that are you know trying to hold onto their cards and they feel like things have already been taken away from them this year with the designated events and smaller fields and no cuts and weighted fedexcup points for the larger events with the stronger fields so they were already feeling somewhat vulnerable then whenever this news is brought about there's only going to be one reaction to that and i understand that and honestly it's hard for me to relate to those guys because i've never been in that position i try to empathize with it but it's hard for me to it's hard for me to relate to them fully but i certainly empathize with their point of view,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-06,2023,47,1,0,1,i don't think you've ever played with lipsky at least on a sunday can you remember ever playing with him in europe,not on the pga tour i might have played with him in europe somewhere when he was over there and playing more regularly i certainly played with him whether that would be in a tournament or a practice round i've certainly played a few holes with him,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-06,2023,102,1,0,1,when you're paired with someone who maybe he hasn't won on the pga tour do you consider that an advantage and if so why,yeah i mean look it's a like it's a big tournament and i've got quite a bit of experience in that and you would like to think that that gives you a little bit of an advantage so everyone's going to go out there tomorrow and regardless of where you are in the tournament this golf course makes you a little uncomfortable anyway so everyone's going to be feeling like that with the way the leaderboard is and how bunched it is it's just going to come down to who can sort of hold their head the most coming down the stretch,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-06,2023,107,1,0,1,they're kind of working on the schedule it's getting close there will be some changes in terms of dates where do you fall over your career playing the week before a major are you kind of pro just take it as it comes,i'm pro it i really like playing the week before a major look there's no better way to get sharp for a golf tournament than to play a golf tournament i think so i really like playing the week before a major i've done it both ways i've won majors not doing it and won majors doing it but i think in an ideal world my favorite two weeks of the year were always akron pga i felt like akron was a great tournament but it also got you prepared for what you were going to face the next week so i love those sorts of stretches,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-06,2023,92,1,0,1,seems and i know the answer to this anyway but i'm just going to ask it that everyone always goes to augusta february march it seems like for a week or for a trip that's the one course you guys know like the back of your hand but nobody goes ahead to the pga or to the u s open,don't worry i was telling myself that for the two weeks afterwards i'm like why i spend so much time here i know it like the back of my hand exactly it's the one course we play from memory rather than what's just right in front of us and from my experience i play better when i just react to what's in front of me instead of playing by memory and oh i remember in i hit it here don't hit it there so sometimes it's nice playing courses a little blind,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-06,2023,39,0,1,1,course or location,i think everything i just think i think west coast u s opens always deliver for some reason i think torrey pines pebble beach even going back to like chambers bay west coast u s opens i really like,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-05,2023,118,1,0,1,MODERATOR,yeah it's always nice to be back at jack's place i've loved this tournament since the first time that i played it i've loved this golf course in all of its different iterations and tweaks over the years it's one of the iconic events on the pga tour i haven't won it yet i would love to be able to put my name on the trophy and walk up that hill and get that handshake from jack that would be pretty nice to do so yeah i'm excited to be back excited to get on a nice little run of golf here coming up over the next few weeks and yeah always good to be in muirfield village,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-05,2023,115,0,1,1,does the swing feeling better than it did at oak hill,i mean i certainly think brooks deserves to be on the united states team i think with how he's played i mean he's second in the u s standings only played two counting events i don't know if there's anyone else on the you know on the liv roster that would make the team on merit and how they're playing but brooks is definitely a guy that i think deserves to be on the u s team but i have different feelings about the european team and the other side and sort of how that has all transpired and yeah i don't think any of those guys should be a part of the european team,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-05,2023,156,0,1,1,jon and patrick were asked yesterday about the ryder cup and about the prospect of having liv guys you've said in the past that you don't think they should be able to play in the ryder cup do you still feel that way,laughing i think jack the guy that i know is probably the guy that you guys know too he's not afraid to voice his opinion i'll go in the lunch room at the bear's club sometimes and if i'm coming off a like say an average week on tour the week before and i see jack in the lunch room i'm like oh no what's he going to say to me laughing so he's not afraid to voice his opinion and obviously having the opinion of someone that has been so successful in our game is a great thing for is a great thing for the people that spend a little bit of time around him but i think the guy that you all see is the guy that we see as well he's a wonderful human being he does a ton a ton for charity he's a very helpful person and hopefully everyone sees that,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-05,2023,1,1,1,1,first of all you talked about as players get older they play less and so forth phil was making this argument at the pga about that the liv schedule may be more conducive to playing better in majors we don't have we don't really have much of an example to go on yet but and certainly it's self serving in a way,laughing,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-05,2023,50,1,0,1,but is there some merit you seem to suggest is there some merit to playing less to prepare more maybe as you get older,you know like it's not you know no one makes anyone play events on the pga tour 's the minimum so you can play and your four major championships and there you go you're at no one's making you play that many so i think that's a pretty flawed argument,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-05,2023,112,1,1,1,are you as a player concerned about the fact that the purses are growing so exponentially including even the majors and is this where the pga tour's having to go into the reserve fund the pga of america the usga i don't think we have to worry about the masters but the r a they're all having to find ways to generate new revenue to meet these purses do you think at some point this is becoming unsustainable,it wouldn't stop me from playing a major but at the same time the major championships basically rent the talent for a week from the pga tour and you could argue from liv and wherever dp world tour and wherever else so the major championships aren't going to be the product that they are without the top players in the world so would that mean that i would or anyone would go to the lengths of not playing a major championship to make a point no but that's just having a reasonable conversation with the governing bodies and the people that run those tournaments and try to come up with a solution,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-05,2023,107,1,0,1,spoken like a true father,yeah and i think the great thing about the pga tour is it feels like one big family and a lot of the families travel poppy's made a lot of friends in the day care program and all that so it's a really nice sense of community which is really nice to have but no i haven't you know i mean that's something i feel like i can figure out on my own but at the same time there's i know there's a lot of people that have went through the same thing and it's nice to know that you can reach out if you want to,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-05,2023,91,1,0,1,could you explain the scene on,i mean it was an amazing golf shot that hole has sort of given me fits all week i haven't really liked the look of it and michael stands up and hits this lovely little draw back into off the left wind and you know ball goes straight in the hole it was i guess sort of when it's your week it's your week in a way and you know i think with the way the week's went for him it was a fitting way to cap off his pga championship,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-05,2023,6,0,1,1,we're coming up on the one year anniversary of the first liv golf tournament if you could look into your crystal ball three years from now where do you think the professional game will be,i don't have a crystal ball,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-05,2023,20,1,0,1,in terms of preparing for majors do you think you've exhausted all the different ways to do it i e play the week before don't play the week before practice a lot or don't practice a lot on the course do you think you've gone through them all and now it's just a case of finding the one that works,this is my th pga championship if i haven't done it all by now i don't know when i will,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-05,2023,116,0,1,1,when you think about what you knew about western new york earlier in your life did you have any impressions of it and have you adopted any western new york pastimes such as the buffalo bills or any kind of cultural things around here,it certainly makes it easier to root for the bills when josh allen is throwing the football not really i didn't know a ton about this part of the world pre i guess the first time we played here i've only had one garbage plate in my life i haven't went overboard with that look i've spent summers here i've spent falls here i've spent a few christmases here i really love the seasons we live in florida we don't get that so it's nice to come up here and see the leaves change in october and have the snow at christmastime there's certainly parts of it that i've really enjoyed and will continue to enjoy,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-05,2023,198,1,0,1,i know when they announced that they were going to move the pga to may which was the one that could have been dicey on the future schedule they're probably going to luck out but in general do you think they could maybe ever come back here for a pga championship in the future and do you like the pga in may as opposed to august,i mean look if we're guaranteed a week like this every time in may then that would be awesome i know we're playing aronimink in a couple of years' time which could potentially be a little chilly as well do i like it in may look the only thing about may is that maybe in the future it'll start to exclude places like this in the northeast to host this championship so that's a shame the northeast is sort of my favorite golf to play in this country i love the golf courses up here and i love the tradition and a lot of the historic golf course architects started their journeys up here and have built some amazing golf courses it would be a shame if we weren't able to come back here i always liked in august that this was glory's last shot and there was a real identity there not saying that it's lost any of that identity in terms of its still a major championship but i feel like having it be the last major of the year maybe just gave it a little bit of something that it doesn't quite have right now,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-05,2023,1,0,1,1,you mentioned earlier about not having a crystal ball obviously we all asked you a lot of questions about liv and you've spoken yourself recently about the burden of that is it going to be a conscious thing for you going forward to try and sidestep that narrative,yeah,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-04,2023,152,1,1,1,it's obviously different communicating online or through headlines than being in person with someone but in a week like this where there's liv guys and a bunch of pga tour guys and all of you guys are intermingling and it seems like everything is okay does it change the dynamic between you guys,i see some of these guys at home i see brooks a lot i see dj a lot we sort of practice at the same place as you said i think the more face time you get with some people the more comfortable you become in some way i'm going to go play nine holes here with brooks in a little bit and look there's so many it's a very nuanced situation and there's different dynamics you know it's okay to get on with brooks and dj and maybe not get on with some other guys that went to liv right it's interpersonal relationships that's just how it goes but this week and this tournament is way bigger than any of that i feel and it's just great that all of the best players in the world are together again for the first time in what seems to be quite a while,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-04,2023,65,1,0,1,have you spoken to phil mickelson at all and curious about your thoughts about his return after last year's absence,i have not i have not spoken to phil but it's great to see him back you know he's a three time champion here we're not even two years removed from him doing what i believe is one of the greatest feats in the game of golf winning the pga championship at years of age or whatever it was it's good to have him back,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-04,2023,44,0,1,1,i don't know if you're aware that the times has reported that the dp world tour that won it case against the liv players can i get your reaction to that please,i don't it looks like it's not going to be announced until thursday so i don't really i don't know if i can comment on it too much but you know if that is the outcome then that certainly changes the dynamic of everything,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-04,2023,221,1,0,1,when you look at the structural changes in the pga tour that have happened how important was the week of the jp mcmanus pro am for having those conversations and building consensus among the top players,yeah so that i think so tiger's really the one that called the meeting the week of that tournament and then the first meeting was actually with jay and the rest of the players and then the second meeting was us on our own and sort of discussing whether we needed like an outside counsel not in a legal term but someone to bounce ideas off that's not within the tour to sort of maybe bring a little bit more clarity i think when you're in something it's maybe hard to take a step back and sort of see the bigger picture in a way so to have someone come in and do that that was the first sort of definitely the initiation of those discussions as that summer progressed zoom calls conference calls different ideas and iterations to get to the point where we met in delaware and what was presented to the players that evening yeah the jp mcmanus pro am was definitely the start of it and then i would say the sort of what was that four or five weeks after that was a pretty important time obviously it was big idea stuff and pie in the sky and not all the details were fleshed out but at least a framework that we could work from basically,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-04,2023,84,1,1,1,yesterday cam was in here talking about the need for them or the want for them for a liv golfer to win this what's your reaction to that us versus them mentality that they have that i don't think exists with you guys and if you or a pga tour peer wins will you storm the th green,depends who it is laughter you know i think that only puts more pressure on themselves that they are not just playing for themselves and they are playing for this cause that might help in some way i don't know but as i said before i think this tournament is bigger than all of that look it's a narrative and a storyline but the masters and the four major championships sit above all that noise and that's the way it should be this week,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-04,2023,212,0,1,1,when you first burst on the scene a lot of people said this kid is definitely going to win the masters his game is tailor made for this course all these years on do you feel that about the course and that the course plays to your strengths perhaps more than every other major venue,it does but they said the same thing about ernie els greg norman i'm not mentioning liv there's been players before that that has been said that you know this course is tailor made for those players and they haven't went on to win a green jacket that's always in my mind too it's not just because a place is deemed you know perfectly set up for your game it doesn't automatically mean that you're going to win it one day there's more to it than that there's also been players that you would think this golf course wouldn't set up well for them and they have went on and won a green jacket look it's a factor and it's nice to know that i come back to this place every year and that if i played the way i know that i can that i should have a good chance yeah i don't need to do anything differently this week i go out and play the way that i know that i can get myself in with a chance to win and then you know those last couple hours on sunday it's not about whether the course sets up well for you it's about who can hold it together the best,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-03,2023,91,0,1,1,new putter new driver as well how important to see those clubs under pressure this week,yeah really good that's the main thing this week obviously there's a ton of golf left this season but to get a little bit of match play in our lives is good and get under pressure there's a couple of putts on the back nine there that i was actually glad i had the hole it's good practice but at the same time i want to win the match as well yeah it was good it was a good first starting for both those clubs and they both performed pretty well,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-03,2023,177,1,1,1,could you just talk from your own personal experience the degree of difficulty of reining in your emotions when things aren't going well,a lot of it i'm not going to sit here and lie i think the emergence of liv or the emergence of a competitor to the pga tour has benefited everyone that plays elite professional golf i think when you've been the biggest golf league in the biggest market in the world for the last years there's not a lot of incentive to innovate this has caused a ton of innovation at the pga tour and what was quite i would say an antiquated system is being revamped to try to mirror where we're at in the world in the st century with the media landscape and just every you know the pga tour isn't just competing with liv golf or other sports it's competing with instagram and tiktok and everything else that's trying to take eyeballs away from the pga tour as a product so yeah you know liv coming along it's definitely had a massive impact on the game but i think everyone who's a professional golfer is going to benefit from it going forward,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-03,2023,58,1,1,1,when you look at what the pga is doing now considering how good its product and even its policies how much of that would you say can be attributed to the emergence of liv golf and the actual news clash that's playing out in the california court right now,yeah i think would it be better if the defending champion was here this week absolutely but he made a decision that he felt was the best thing for him and he knew that decision was going to come with consequences and one of the consequences is right now not being able to play on the pga tour,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-03,2023,180,1,1,1,given the defending champion isn't here i'm just curious about what the people's sentiment is like at the moment,i hope so i mean i think i've been doing a pretty good job of trying to balance both of those things i feel like over the past months i've played pretty well but at the same time i've had all of this other stuff to deal with when i went on the board of the pga tour i didn't imagine it would take up this much time but i think it's been important work and i'm proud of the steps that we and the pga tour have made to try to make everything better for the membership and try to stem the flow of players that have went to liv but yeah hopefully with these new changes that have been announced hopefully the majority of my time will be spent on concentrating on getting ready for golf tournaments and trying to be the best player that i can be not that i feel like it's taken away any of that but it might give me a bit more free time to do other things that i enjoy as well,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-03,2023,135,1,0,1,do you feel that five european victories here if i've done my math correctly is a fair return on in terms of european players playing in this event do you feel they've underachieved or do you think that's about right there's a general perception which of course can be wrong that its probably not quite as good as it should be what do you feel about that,i guess i would have to look at historical averages of european players winning on the pga tour and seeing what percentage that is compared to i don't know how many players championships have been staged something so you're saying five european winners in so over percent i don't feel like that's a bad average but yeah i would have to dig into it more i mean as the years have went on we've had more and more europeans play in this event so you would like to think that the chances of european victory are going to become more and more as those participation levels increase but if someone just was to say to me that percent of players championships have been won by europeans i would say that that's a pretty good return,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-03,2023,63,0,1,1,yeah here,not anymore i mean all the top europeans live here they play on this tour you could maybe have made that argument years ago but i just think with the way the professional golf landscape is we all base ourselves in this country and specifically in this area in florida at this time of the year so i don't think there's any excuses,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-03,2023,66,1,0,1,you clipped kurt at the cj cup in the fall did you say anything in particular to him when you guys were shaking hands afterwards,not really probably just said really good week i think he's been playing pretty well i sort of know kurt more from european tour stuff because he played over there but he's done really well he's sort of persevered and played wherever he could get starts and all of a sudden he's won one of the biggest events on the pga tour so good for him,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-03,2023,65,1,0,1,irish open,irish open spanish open scottish open is obviously a co sanctioned event now which is a big step forward wentworth there's a few obvious ones that stick out that could you could try to incorporate into more of a world tour schedule more so than it just being purely dp world purely pga tour and trying to sort of combine the two a little bit,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-03,2023,21,1,0,1,do you feel like there could be even more team play on the pga tour there's limited play now,we finished second we had a chance but the air came out of the balloon on where we both made bogey,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-03,2023,176,1,1,1,what's your reaction to this latest pga tour scheduling change coming up in and as a follow is there a concern at all with the quote unquote non stars the rank and file guys in terms of not as many opportunities to play and maybe leaving them on the outside looking in,well we've always had no cut events on this tour if you think of like the four wgc's you've got the three playoffs events you've got the cj cup the zozo so there's precedent there for no cut events the only reason no cut events are a big deal is because liv has come along so there is precedent for no cut events there's been no cut events since i've been a member of the tour and way beyond that as well so yeah is there maybe going to be a few more of them maybe that's still tbd by the way that's not been decided yet but if we do go down that path there's precedent there to argue for no cut events it keeps the stars there for four days you ask mastercard or whoever it is to pay million dollars for a golf event they want to see the stars at the weekend they want a guarantee that the stars are there so if that's what needs to happen then that's what happens,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-03,2023,100,1,0,1,as a native of rochester new york and a former member of oak hill country club i would like to get your thoughts on this year's pga championship,i'm looking forward to it i think andrew green's done a really good job i think the renovation has hopefully restored the east course back to its former glory i would say i'm just hoping for a good weather week i think that's what everyone's hoping for up there in may but excited to go back to oak hill from the last time i was there or we were all there my connection to rochester's got a lot stronger so i'm excited to go and play a major championship in what feels like almost like a second home to me,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-02,2023,107,1,0,1,the conditions out here are one thing but the fans and the atmosphere is another for people out here is this the best fan experience on tour or is it an anomaly for you guys,i'm not in the crowd and i'm not whatever but i think if i wasn't a player and i wanted to come to one pga tour event this would probably be the one that i'd want to come to i was joking to harry out there today it's like almost you get two free rounds at this because you can go out and just completely wing it either shoot or and you know you're going to have a good weekend regardless either have a chance to win the tournament or you go and enjoy everything that this tournament has to offer if you don't make the cut,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-02,2023,162,1,0,1,MODERATOR,yeah i feel like it's been a while since i've played on the pga tour last october i guess but yeah look it's been a good start to the year winning over in dubai and yeah making my second start here i haven't had the full experience of this event yet it was limited fans in ' with only people i'm looking forward to it this week in some ways but it's going to be an experience i think when we started talking about trying to elevate or designate some events i think this was one of the first ones on the list just because it's such a fan favorite and players like it players love the atmosphere i think a lot of players like the golf course as well yeah it was a pretty sort of obvious one to make a it was already a huge event but made even bigger happy to be here and looking forward to the week,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-01,2023,45,0,1,1,you didn't feel the feed to duck,i mean exactly right like that's i mean i got a subpoena on christmas eve i mean i don't see your like you can't pretend like nothing's happening right i think that's the thing like why we are living in reality here he's no so,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-01,2023,1,0,1,1,can i just ask you for your reaction it looks like there's been sort of various bits of movement with liv that has been portrayed as strengthening greg norman's position in the top of that organization we all know what you said when you were back here in november so i just wonder if you have any reaction to that,yeah,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-01,2023,119,0,1,1,when you mentioned being mentally drained at the end of the year how much of that is from all the extracurricular stuff that you're doing with liv,i mean i think there is on reflection last year i felt like i needed to take on quite a lot but i think getting the wheels in motion of how hopefully the new system and the new yeah i keep calling it a product but the new structure of professional golf like getting those wheels in motion it look a lot of effort last year but now those wheels are in motion we just have to try to tidy up the schedule for but i feel like most of the heavy lifting was done last year we still have quite a bit of work to do but you know hopefully this year it won't be quite as taxing,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-01,2023,219,1,0,1,last year you returned to the top spot in the world ranking a testament to the consistency you have shown major championships are always on the radar is there anything that you do differently this year to give yourself a better opportunity to start winning more of those trophies,i mean yeah it's hard because when you look at the you just look purely at the results of the majors last year the masters is the one that i did the best at but it's the one that i had the least chance in i felt like i had a chance going into the last day of the pga the u s open and obviously the open as well i just have to keep doing the same things it's a shot here it's a putt there and i think all of these experiences of knocking on the door it sort of felt similar going back to i was knocking on the door for my first win as a pro i was beaten in a playoff in crans i was beaten in a playoff in hong kong i had a chance to win in south africa i was knocking on the door and i think all of those experiences you learn something from them and then as long as you can like get right back on the horse and try to rectify what mistake you made or what you can learn from like that's sort of the process i feel like i'm going through again trying to win a major that i haven't won coming up in nine years,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-01,2023,196,0,1,1,last year was a big political year for the game of golf and you were front and center for that do you feel like you delivered what you delivered on the course in spite are or because of what was going on,i would say a little bit of both i would say there was parts of it were because of and other parts just in spite of i think i said a lot last year and i wanted my actions to match my words so there's no point in just being a mouthpiece when you can't back that up by playing good golf and showing people the rewards people can have out here if they are playing well and it's a merit based system that's the thing that i've always struggled with if a five year old boy or girl know that they work hard and they shoot the scores there's a merit based system in golf all the way through junior golf amateur golf all the way up to the professional level and they can make it to the top levels of the game and this is the one thing that's come into the game that has disrupted that and you're not certain you're not certain to play on that league or that tour it's not a merit based system where i think golf has always been that and i've always appreciated that about our game,0
rory mcilroy,0,2023-01,2023,65,0,1,1,there's also an element of naivete for someone to think he's doing what he is in the world at the moment that everybody should be able to get on with what's happening,yeah i was subpoenaed by his lawyer on christmas eve so of course trying to have a nice time with my family and someone shows up on your doorstep and delivers that you're not going to take that well so again i'm living in reality i don't know where he's living if i were in his shoes i wouldn't expect a hello or a handshake,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-11,2022,189,1,0,1,MODERATOR,yeah obviously over the last couple of holes today i knew that i was still trying to figure out a way to win the golf tournament i knew i had the rankings sort of over and done with i was speaking to harry about it on the last couple of holes and you know he said to me a long way from san antonio that was sort of where my whole year turned around and then i played augusta and played great there my golf and my consistency levels just went to i don't think i played as consistent in my entire career as i'm doing right now it's been a fantastic year both sides of the pond whenever the pga tour the fedexcup was over and done with mid august i turned my attention to try and win over here and played quite a bit you know played wentworth and italy and the dunhill and now here and it was nice to achieve that objective so great way to end the year and it's been busy for a lot of reasons and looking forward to some down time,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-11,2022,129,1,0,1,are you normally a man for like that or did it occur to you after the fedexcup let's get europe as well,yeah maybe hopefully down the line with the strategic alliance that you'll start to see more of a pga tour dp world tour than or something like that i'd say for next year it's going to be pretty similar in terms of i'm going to play back here in dubai at the end of january and then i probably won't play in europe again until july and then you play your three fedexcup events in august and then again you come back over here and i'll play probably the irish open before the ryder cup yeah it sort of seems like that's the way the schedule is going to be next year anyway is still up in the air because there's a lot of things to be decided on,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-11,2022,63,0,1,1,and finally what was the dynamic like out there obviously playing with someone who has had a bit of liv experience this season,yeah it was fine look i've known adrian a long time he probably put in one of the most impressive performances this year going under par around valderrama is an unbelievable achievement look it is what it is he's a great player he deserve to be here because he's made it into the top and he's played well the dynamic was absolutely fine,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-11,2022,77,1,1,1,it's been a year like no other for the game of golf in again if you could give a end of the year assessment of where we are at the game and greg norman and saying yourself and tiger and every pga tour player should be thankful for what liv has done i wonder if you can give us an assessment,so i don't think it will have another year like this one because all of the noise has been about who jumping ship who is going where who is staying who is going very little of the storyline has actually been about the golf so i think next year if we can get the storylines to being about the golf and being about the competition that's happening and what's happening on the course that's a good thing,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-11,2022,152,1,0,1,can i ask you about this golf course where you are under par for the years that you've played here almost under par every round what is your mindset when you come to a golf course where you have done so well,yeah in terms of the consistency especially in the majors it's probably yeah i didn't win one of the big four but second at augusta third at the open fifth at the u s open and eighth at the pga it's been very consistent i've said this year felt very similar to very similar numbers in terms of strokes gained if anything i was a little better this year stats wise better around the greens definitely putted better it's the first time i ever finished in the top in putting on the pga tour this year so it's really nice at this stage of my career ways in i'm still finding ways to improve that's a really positive thing going forward so it's been a great year and i'm excited to see where i go from here because as i said those improvements years into a career is something that excites me,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-11,2022,254,1,1,1,where does this season rank for you in terms of consistency obviously you haven't won one of the four that you would have hoped for but everything else has been pretty much on the money where would this stand for you,so i think there's a few things that need to happen so there's obviously two lawsuits going on at the minute there's pga tour versus liv and there's this one that's coming up with the dp world tour in february nothing will happen if those two things are still going on especially yeah you're limited in what you can do and then i think from whatever happens with those two things there's a few things that i would like to see on the liv side that needs to happen i think greg needs to go i think he just needs to exit stage left he's made his mark but i think now is the right time to sort of say look you've got this thing off the ground but no one is going to talk unless there's an adult in the room that can actually try to mend fences and if those two things happen then things can happen but right now it's a stale mate because there can't be any other way hopefully something can happen who knows but right now i think the separate entities the pga tour european tour and iv are both going to be one is a very different product to the other and they are just going to keep going whether something happens and whether that's in the hand of a court or a judge or something else happens along the way no one really knows but right now it seems like it's a bit of a stalemate,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-11,2022,125,1,0,1,you've said it yourself that at some point people need to get around the people do you think that's actually possible with what's been said by the protagonists involved and the head of the pga and greg norman is it possible to see those two guys sitting down,yeah i think in time that can happen it's obviously been a very contentious year in golf and i've said this the best thing in golf is to have all the best players playing together and what's happening right now that's not happening so i fear for the game when that's going on that's why again with everything it's contentious because there's lawsuits going on and people suing people it's very very messy so again if all that stuff can be sorted out one way or the other then you can get to the stage where there's forgiveness and people can have dialogue and come to some sort of common ground or compromise but while all this is happening it's very hard to do that,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-09,2022,222,0,1,1,taking you back a few years you had a comment with paul lawrie in your second event if you look back the majors wgc titles,i think when you embark on a professional career i think i just sort of took it one step at a time i wanted to get my tour card and once i did that i wanted to play the majors the wgcs i didn't start off with grand ambitions of say tiger having pictures of jack nicklaus on his wall i didn't even know he had that so i guess i just wanted to become the best golfer that i could and whether that meant i was at a certain level or the levels i reached i just always try to get the best out of myself yeah when i look back over the years it's an amazing life it's an amazing career provides you with amazing things obviously but you still have to remember where you came from and yeah i have to pinch myself sometimes and i have to give myself that little perspective because you know even on the th green today i made a putt for eagle just stuff like that even just being in that position to have a chance to win on at st andrews it's just stuff that you dream about as a kid i get to live out my childhood dreams and not everybody can say that it's an unbelievable position to be in,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-09,2022,113,0,1,1,your thoughts on the letter from the liv players the loss of rankings becoming obsolete,i certainly would want the best players in the world ranked accordingly i think dustin johnson is somewhere around th in the world it's not an accurate reflection of where he is in the game but at the same time you can't make up your own rules there's criteria there and everyone knows what they are if they want to pivot to meet the criteria they can and then all of a sudden i certainly have no problem with them getting world ranking points at all but you just have to meet the criteria and if you don't meet the criteria it's going to be hard to justify why you should have them,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-09,2022,62,0,1,1,just wondered if this were any discussions with luke donald being here this week getting some experience on the ryder cup course for next year,i can't speak on behalf of them if they will come in may i'm not sure what liv's schedule looks like if there's tournament on that week or where in the world they are playing but yeah i have said it once i've said it a hundred times i don't think any of those guys should be on the ryder cup team,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-09,2022,155,0,1,1,seems obvious that the fact that none of the well known live guys are here week nor should they expect to play,yeah she was a wonderful human being wonderful lady i think you see the outpouring of love and he motion that you've seen over the past few days it sort of shows how admired she was and how strongly people felt about her i said this last week she shows so much dignity and dedication and grace towards what she did she put duty over everything else and i'm sure that was a very heavy crown to wear excuse the pun she was a wonderful person i think she had handled herself with absolutely incredible grace and she'll be very very missed i think that's parent from the scenes over the past few days but life goes on and we are all going to have our time where we are not here anymore but she left a wonderful legacy and she had a wonderful life you know she'll be remembered for a very long time,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-09,2022,117,1,0,1,players say when they come off a big win that it's definitely to get back up again and the adrenaline really flowing you seem to not suffer from that what's the secret to that,i think winning gives me motivation more than anything else you've proven that you can win and you can beat the best players in the world if you can't get energised by that i don't know what will energise you i always have this sense of excitement after a win that i'm breaking through or got to where i want to be or i'm on the right path it's good resetting goals too the pga tour season is over for me turn my attention to europe try to win the race to dubai so it's all about you have to enjoy your wins too but you have to keep resetting your goals to strive for other things,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-09,2022,78,0,1,1,you said previously that you would find it hard to stomach the or liv players being here this week how have you found it so far,it's been i mean i haven't many of them to be honest look it is what it is they are here they are playing the golf tournament my opinion is they shouldn't be here but again that's just my opinion but we are all going to tee it up on the first tee tomorrow and we are all going to go play holes which is a novelty for them at this point and then we'll go from there,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-09,2022,195,1,1,1,obviously with all that's been going on with liv and it's impact on the golf ecosystem what have you we've heard you speak at length at how the pga tour can react to it and how it's going to be going forward we have not heard you speak about the impact on the dp world tour what do you see that impact being and how can this organisation the european tour as was counter what is going on at the moment,yeah so i think again the strategic alliance or partnership with the pga tour has been a massive help to the european tour in terms of the prize funds that are going to be played for over the next five years guaranteed prize funds i think that partnership sort of helps it helps the rank and file in europe knowing they are going to be teeing it up every week and playing for more money essentially and you know it's a pathway to the most competitive tour in the world you know there's ten cards that are going to be allocated to european tour members every year going to the pga tour and that's such a great thing it's a better pathway than there's ever been i think about how much better i became as a golfer by going and playing over there to have these young europeans having that opportunity i'm just thinking about ryder cup and the future and like how much better prepared they are going to be for that i mean that's going to be such a great thing going forward so i'm excited about it i'm very bullish about it,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-09,2022,145,1,0,1,when those discussions are happening and you're privy to them are you sitting at the table fighting for europe's corner,yeah i am because if we are talking about this and you canning about elevated events and brick the best people together i think for the benefit of the global game a handful of those events need to be in europe i've said that from the start this has to be this can't be american centric this has to be with this region in mind with wherever we want to go and play i think that has to happen but i think the partnership between the pga tour and the european tour is mutual beneficial because i think by partnering with the dp world tour the pga tour unlocks that global nature of the game that they have not really been able to get a stronghold over and i think by partnering together i think you're going to see more of that which is great,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-09,2022,125,0,1,1,you touched briefly on the ryder cup and you were very emotive in your speech at the end of the last one rule all three of those players on that team now liv golf members i'm thinking of westy sergio poults incredibly disruptive in this period your relationship with them does it survive and how does it survive going forward,i don't know i have no idea i wouldn't say i've got much of a relationship with them at the minute but again like if you're just talking about ryder cup like that's not the future of the ryder cup team they are they have played in probably a combined ryder cups ryder cups whatever it is it's time that and that's why i was talking about these ten cards going to the u s and preparing guys to play at the top level of professional golf like that's the future of the ryder cup the højgaards bobby mac whoever else is coming up like they are the future of the ryder cup team that's what we should be like thinking about and talking about,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-09,2022,99,1,0,1,for some reason on social media people question your loyalty to the dp world tour because of your relationship with the pga tour and your pac role etc,i'm loyal to golf that's the thing golf was here way before we all were and golf will be around much longer golf is going to survive regardless like we are just a little blip on the continuum of this game but you want to make sure that you leave the game in a better place than you found it i think that's where my loyalty lies again like i'm an ambitious person i want to play where the best players are playing and for last decade or more the last players have predominately played in the united states,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-09,2022,10,0,1,1,do you see a way back for liv golf players somewhere down the line if they decided that wasn't for them and they wanted to come back to the traditional tours,i mean they can always go through q school yeah,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-09,2022,368,1,1,1,it was very interesting to hear you say just now with a smile on your face bring it on in answer to phil's question you seem very comfortable being in the forefront of all this and the spokesman for it golf magazine design has recently described you as the voice of reason and seth waugh obviously a friend of yours spoke very very well about you and your growth horizontally as well as vertically why are you so comfortable in this,i don't know i'm speaking up for what i believe in i guess that's the only thing i can say again i'm speaking up because i believe in the game of golf and look the other side will say the exact same thing but i don't see how having cherry picked players is growing the game in any way there has to be pathways there has to be meritocracy there has to be you need to give someone the ambitious or opportunity todd know that if they are playing on the challenge tour that whatever it is in a year's time two years' time or five years' that they can be challenging for major championships which are the pinnacle of our sport there is this pyramid and this funnel that has been so good for golf for so many years and i don't think it's a broken system so whenever something like this comes along that is incredibly disruptive and they are saying things about how golf needs to change it doesn't need to change golf is the most wonderful game in the world it doesn't yeah could there be things that we could do to make it more entertaining from a tv product perspective of course that's something that i think we can do from inside the walls i don't think we need to go outside of what we have already to figure that out but the game of golf post covid has been thriving and i just want to make sure that it continues to thrive it's incredibly divisive and does it bring more eyeballs on to golf probably because people are interested in the soap opera of it all but that's not golf the most interesting thing about liv is the rumours and who is going and who is not going it's not the golf right now it might be at some stage but right now what it is it's the rumour mill that's fuelling it so when you come back here and you play dp world tour or pga tour you're watching the golf and you're watching who is going to win tournaments and have context and mean something that's why i'm speaking up,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-09,2022,72,0,1,1,if come sunday down the stretch you find yourself in contention and the man to the side of you is a liv player would there be more incentive to win,i mean i'll be trying to win a golf tournament regardless they are going to be pretty tired on sunday it will be the fourth day but no look i'll be trying to win a golf tournament regardless my focus is i'm in a great position in the race to dubai and i want to finish the season off well because i think it would be a really cool double to do,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-08,2022,114,1,0,1,we talked about the open how the putts didn't fall i know that was tough for you it was a tough couple of days after that given everything that's happened this year and the role you've taken front and center with the changing landscape in the sport how satisfying is it for you to stand here at the end of the season and win this year's fedexcup,it means an awful lot i believe in the game of golf i believe in this tour in particular i believe in the players on this tour it's the greatest place in the world to play golf bar none and i've played all over the world this is an incredibly proud moment for me but it should also be an incredibly proud moment for the pga tour they've had some hard times this year but we're getting through it that was a spectacle out there today two of the best players in the world going head to head for the biggest prize on the pga tour and i hope everyone at home enjoyed that,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-08,2022,84,1,1,1,finally with what this means to you it's fair to say it's been a pretty stressful year in the world of golf there's been a lot going on and you have really taken it on yourself to be a spokesperson for the pga tour you've been at the forefront and honest in your in your opinion in your fight for the pga tour and what it means does that make winning the fedexcup this year specifically extra special,it does everyone on tour has had to deal with a lot even the guys that have went to liv have had to deal with a lot it's just been a very tumultuous sort of era in our game i said it in the sort of prize ceremony there this is the best place in the world to play golf it's the most competitive it's got the best players it's got the deepest fields i don't know why you'd want to play anywhere else,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-08,2022,166,1,0,1,rory i know you don't want to compare the three of them they all mean something different but given what this year has been like just for you not only competitively but off the golf course does it hold any special meaning being able to do it here,i think so look it's been a tumultuous time for the world of men's professional golf in particular i've been right in the middle of it i've picked a great time to go on the pga tour board but yeah i've been in the thick of things i guess every chance i get i'm trying to defend what i feel is the best place to play elite professional golf in the world it's in some ways fitting that i was able to get this done today to sort of round off a year that has been very very challenging and different yeah they're all sort of different it's been nice back in i took down the no player in the world in brooks koepka this year i took down the no player in the world in scottie scheffler so i know that my best stuff is good enough to win any tournament against anybody on any golf course that's something i can take away from today,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-08,2022,123,0,1,1,for someone who's accomplished what you have in golf what's more valuable to you the million or having won that,having won i mean there's a lot of cool things that come along with winning the fedexcup the trophy i have three sterling silver calamity jane replicas in my house which is really cool to think about here at east lake and bobby jones the greatest amateur player to ever play the game the sort of history and traditions of the game of golf he sort of exemplified all that look the money is the money it's great and we are professional golfers we play golf for a living that is a part of it but i think at this point in my career the winning and the journey and the emotions and who i do it with mean more than the check,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-08,2022,150,1,0,1,rory you had that great moment with poppy at the pga championship where you told her hey that's when daddy was good and since then you've won twice and obviously a lot of other things this season do you think you can look at her and be like hey i think daddy is good again,i think daddy was still good at that point but maybe a little better now than he was a few months ago yeah look i want my daughter to see me play well and win golf tournaments and i want to be the best version of myself in front of her there's a part of that that's being a father and being a husband but it's also being a golfer is a huge part of my life so i want her to be proud of who i am as a golfer too look there was truth in that statement but she probably just went to bed now so i'll see her in the morning but it's cool to be able to do these things and celebrate it with them and make it known that they're a part of the journey and they're so valuable to all of this as well,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-08,2022,171,1,0,1,MODERATOR,yeah always great to make it to east lake at the end of the year it means you've had a very solid season yeah i've had a lot of success at east lake over the years this is my ninth time at east lake and i've won a couple of them i've had chances the majority of the times i've been here to win the fedexcup great to have another opportunity to try to do something that no one has ever done before in the short history of what the fedexcup is but yeah excited to be back i felt like i got my golf game together a little bit better in wilmington last week and played okay i need to make a few more putts this week to have a chance yeah just want to give it another solid week and try to finish the pga tour season on a high before i have a whopping five days off before i go over to europe and start playing over there,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-08,2022,385,1,0,1,MODERATOR,i don't know if i could pinpoint a time when that happened i think i've maybe over the last two or three years just sort of evolved into that role i care deeply about our sport i care about its history i care about its legacy i care about the integrity of the game there's a lot of players out here that are like minded and share those same views i felt it was just right i think the one thing that has sort of happened over the years is we all sort of are our own little independent businesses and we sort of try to compete against each other and i think this is the first time in a long time where we sort of all sat down and were like let's try to be business partners how can we all pull in the same direction here to benefit everyone and to help the entire tour and to help each other basically i said this a few days ago unfortunately tiger woods doesn't play as much as he used to tiger woods was the single biggest draw that the pga tour had amongst other things we have to recognize that so for the of us that were in that room last tuesday night including tiger we all have to sit down okay what is the best thing for our tour going forward what can we do to help put forward the best product possible so that in years' time the pga tour is still thriving and we can safeguard the future of the tour that was basically what last week was about it was amazing to have tiger in the room because of his influence but all those players in that room bought into the vision that tiger and i and others have sort of came up with it's not as if we did this as a renegade group we kept jay privy to all these sort of discussions so he could try to make some moves internally to try to get stuff happening pretty quickly and obviously that has culminated in some of the announcements that have been made today i'm sure there will be some changes going forward as well but i think today was a great step in the right direction,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-08,2022,188,1,0,1,MODERATOR,yeah so i think i saw a stat yesterday that apart from the major championships and maybe the players the top players top players in the world get together to play against each other one other time during the year and that just doesn't i think if you're trying to sell a product to tv and to sponsors and to try to get as many eyeballs on professional golf as possible you need to at least let people know what they're tuning in for when i tune into a tampa bay buccaneers game i expect to see tom brady throw a football when i tune into a formula race i expect to see lewis hamilton in a car sometimes what's happened on the pga tour is we all act independently and we sort of have our own schedules and that means that we never really get together all that often i think what came out of the meeting last week and what jay just was up here announcing is the fact that we've all made a commitment to get together more often to make the product more compelling,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-08,2022,215,1,1,1,MODERATOR,i mean a bunch of tours have coexisted over the last i don't know how many years you've had the pga tour the european tour the asian tour the sunshine there's a million different golf tours that have all been able to coexist in some way but there was a there's levels there's levels to it right and everyone is trying to make it to the top level of professional golf which is the pga tour look the pga tour are going to do what they're going to do liv are going to do what they're going to do i think at this point jay said it best the pga tour are just trying to control what they can control and try to put forward the best product possible for people to tune into for sponsors to get excited about for tv to get excited about and for the players to get excited about i think having the top players in the world playing together more often and competing against each other more often is i think it's what everyone wants it's what the players want it's what the fans want most importantly and i think once we solve for that a lot of the rest of the stuff sort of takes care of itself,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-08,2022,309,1,1,1,MODERATOR,yeah it's funny i never in a million years thought that i would be in this position in particular and in this position doing this stuff with tiger woods i said to him the other day i remember the first golf shot i ever seen him hit live it was the th hole at mount juliet whenever the amex was there in i drove down with my dad and i watched him hit a drive off the fifth tee and a long iron into the middle of the green a par tiger was my idol ever since i watched him play the u s amateur but to it's an honor just to get to know him he has been an idol and a hero of mine over the years and i feel pretty lucky that i've gotten to know him more intimately than some and he is so passionate about what we're doing he realizes that the pga tour give him a platform to build his brand and let him be who he is and he is so he has tremendous respect about the people that have come before us i think this for him is all about what jack and arnie created in the ' s and everyone that has come before us and i think for someone like me and my generation trying to do something to respect the generation that came before me tiger being the prime example and just trying to carry that legacy on i think that's really what he's trying to do here but having his influence and having his counsel not just myself but all of the players on the pga tour he's a great advocate to have and it's awesome to be doing these things with him i have to pinch myself pretty much every day that i'm in this position,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-08,2022,176,1,0,1,MODERATOR,so anyone has a chance to play their way into these elevated events anyone has a chance to feature in the player impact program like that's the thing the reason we're trying to do this is we're trying to build a tour for the future young ambitious players that want to be the best players in the game if you want to be the best player in the game the pga tour is where you want to be because it is a pure meritocracy there's nothing stopping guys from playing in these elevated events there's nothing stopping guys from getting in the pip you just play better you work your ass off you play better and if you do that you will get into these events that's as simple as it is everyone has the same opportunity everyone starts the week at even par apart from this week but everyone has the same opportunity at the start of every week to make something of themselves and to compete and that's the beautiful thing about this tour,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-08,2022,144,1,0,1,MODERATOR,no i think one of the we need to make this tour more global i think that the pga tour has taken some steps towards that with the japan event or the korean event and obviously the strategic alliance with the european tour and sort of figuring out where that will go over time but i certainly think there is a lot of opportunity to make this tour more global i think you look at the membership on tour you look at the players that are the top players on the pga tour they're not just american you've got me in there you've got europeans you've got asian players you've got south americans you've got australians i mean you've got players from all over the world i think that the pga tour need to be represented in all of those regions in the world,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-08,2022,155,1,1,1,rory obviously with all of the conversation about liv and all the changes that were announced today you have taken on a much more active role in the direction that the tour is going what was the point for you where you decided to be more than just a golfer and to be an actual influence on the direction of the sport going forward,yeah as much as i probably don't want to give phil any sort of credit at all yeah there were certain points that he was trying to make but there's a way to go about them there's a way to collaborate there's a way you get all the top players in the world together and you get them on the same page you then go to the tour and you suggest ideas and you work together this was pure collaboration as i said this isn't some sort of renegade group trying to take some sort of power grab of the pga tour this is okay how can we make this tour better for everyone that's going to play on it now and everyone that's going to play on the pga tour going forward were some of these ideas did they have merit of course they did but he just didn't approach it the right way,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-08,2022,249,1,1,1,rory do you think that your commitment the other top in this pip would have been there if not for the threat of liv,yeah couldn't be more excited to partner with tiger and mike on this project as mike said we've been working on this for two years i think when someone comes to you and says i've got something to show you i think it'll be really cool it'll enhance the fan experience it'll be additive and complementary to the pga tour season oh and by the way tiger woods is involved it's like yeah i think that would be pretty cool i think it's a great opportunity for pga tour players to show a different side of themselves primetime on monday night i think it's great for brand exposure to try to engage a different audience we've all heard about the fact of how old the golf audience is trying to get younger eyeballs on to it i just think it's going to be a really cool concept tiger and i are incredibly excited we shared this vision with the room of players last week in wilmington some of those players were already involved it's just i guess another prong to what the pga tour are trying to do to push the tour forward and there was so much excitement in the room with that as well it'll be partly owned by the players this league so players can get equity in this league as well it's awesome i think it's great for everyone involved fans tv players the tour in general yeah couldn't be more excited to get going,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-08,2022,9,0,1,1,the tour had previously talked about creating three limited field events for top players overseas in the fall now having created this elevated event series presumably that's under some question whether or not they do that is there a danger that the tour is conceding the rest of the world outside the united states to liv or any other entity,this might be a little more sophisticated than that,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-08,2022,95,1,0,1,did the pga tour need someone like him who's got that experience of playing between the ropes to be more involved in tour decisions,i think so we're not looking for former players to run this the players are players and management are management and they're executives and they're trained to run businesses and run that's not what we do but i think just maybe that missing link where jason can take ideas from players and maybe articulate them better to jay and his executive team and the board and everything else again he's a player advocate he wants to do everything as well as possible to make the players as happy as possible and it's a good addition,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-08,2022,118,1,0,1,which do you think is easier for a businessman to come in and learn what it's like to be a player or a player to learn what it's like to run the business,i would say it's probably more difficult for a player to come in and try to figure out how to run especially a business as complicated as the pga tour that's a c but all the tournaments are c s and then all the different yeah look i've only been on the board for a year but i mean all the executive team came to my house and spent four or five hours with me just sort of bringing me through the entire tour business and sort of trying to help me understand how everything works so it's been a massive education for me this year and i'm still trying to get my head around all of it,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-07,2022,135,1,0,1,do you feel this is your best major performance since ',yeah it's up there i don't know i go back to the couple u s opens in the last couple years i feel like i played really well and given myself good chances i was tied for the lead with nine holes to go at torrey pines i got myself in with a great chance at the pga and the u s open this year augusta is going to end up being my best finish of the four but i never really felt like i was in contention there i had a putt to i thought at the time to force a playoff at carnoustie in i've been close and i keep knocking on the door i can't get too down on myself because the game is there it's just a matter of staying patient,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-07,2022,165,1,0,1,you had two really good starts at majors at the u s pga and u s open now you didn't quite back them up probably as much as you would like but you have today was there a mindset out there today keeping in mind that the fact that the u s open and u s pga you had that experience there,watching the coverage earlier on the course looked easy it was one of those you needed to go out and make birdies it wasn't like you could be defensive at all you had to go out and play well and make birdies because everyone was doing that this morning so sort of just tried to play a little bit more on the front foot and be a little more aggressive and i got off to a quiet start but then i sort of came to life around the middle of the round but yeah it depends on the wind tomorrow if the wind is similar it's going to be the same you're going to see guys go out or under par and hang on coming in you're sort of having to keep pace with sort of getting off to a fast start and again as i said trying to make your score over those first holes and then try to play smart in the wind,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-07,2022,91,1,0,1,you mentioned the fast start at pga and u s open and then kind of faded not faded but didn't win those obviously did you take away anything from like just how those last three rounds at both of those tournaments went that will change your mindset going into the last three rounds here,it's quite stop start but i think st andrews is that way there's a lot of crisscrossing and waiting on other greens and waiting on greens to clear because the drivable par s so i think especially the first two days when it's the full field it's to be expected it is what it is thankfully it speeds up over the weekend and two balls and it gets moving a little bit more but i think playing this tournament you expect it to be that way the first couple of days,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-07,2022,160,1,0,1,to follow up on that first rory is the holy grail for you the open here or the masters,i think the legacy that tiger has built over years the platform for him to do it has basically been the pga tour so i think he appreciates the platform that he was given at the very start and able obviously to play as good as he's played but then to have that platform to build his brand too and do everything else even just outside of hitting a golf ball that's made him who he is and i think as well he's such a big guy on history and tradition and he's chasing a record that sam snead has held for i don't know how many years the amount of victories on the pga tour and i think those traditions and the history of the game are very important to him and i think he doesn't want to see that all go away i think that's a big part of the reason why his position is what it is,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-07,2022,126,1,1,1,then my question for you is you've kind of become the de facto speaker for the pga tour on matters with liv tiger woods has been very much in the pga tour camp why do you think that is and how has he influenced you in any way to feel that way,it's the th open championship and that's what we need to focus on i think the focus would have been taken away a little bit if he'd have been here i supported that decision and i think right now because of everything that's happening in the golf world i think it was the right decision to be made but if things change in the future or whatever happens who knows but i could see a day where he's certainly welcome back but right now just with everything going on we want the focus to be on the th open championship and this being a celebration of a wonderful golf tournament and a wonderful game in general and i think it was the right decision for that,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-07,2022,137,1,0,1,rory last month you created a bit of a viral moment when you said my st pga tour title one more than somebody else that somebody else clearly being greg norman greg norman has quite dramatically been disinvited from this week's th celebrations are you quite relieved that he's not going to be here given the circus that he's been creating,i actually was very yesterday for those four holes he was moving better than i'd seen him move in a while that was really good to see and his swing hitting the golf ball and swinging the club aren't the issue it's the walking part of it that's the struggle but he seemed to be moving well everything looked pretty good yesterday so that's encouraging i saw j d briefly saw little john briefly he was sort of telling me what his schedule is coming up and what tournaments he's playing i think he said he finished second or third in the florida state amateur at the bear's club a couple of weeks ago he's turning into a good little player and it will be exciting to sort of follow his progress as the years go on,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-07,2022,106,0,1,1,rory there seemed to be some contradictory statements made by you last week one at mcmanus talking about liv and also some comments that were given to kyle porter in regards to liv as well just wondering if you could clarify exactly what your position is also as a board member you have the ability to probably vote at some point if you would permanently suspend the players that have left for liv how would you vote in permanently suspending players,i'm certainly not at the reminiscing point of my career yet i'm very proud of my achievements and i'm proud of what i've achieved in the game but i know that there's still a lot more that i want to achieve and a lot more that i can achieve i look back fondly on what i've done so far but i still feel like i've got another decade or more of really good golf left in me so yeah i'm firmly looking ahead and trying to make the most of however long left i've got in this game then what was the question about tiger sorry,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-07,2022,74,0,1,1,that was all part of the same question just one other thing if i may you talked a lot about how you clearly understand the significance of the th open with all the history and stuff does that make it maybe better for the game if you get a player winning that isn't involved in liv do you think,that's a moment you dream about especially being from this part of the world this was the major championship it was the first one i ever attended as a kid yeah it just means a little bit more yeah to hear your name and winner of the gold medal champion golfer of the year it's what dreams are made of i still remember that pretty vividly i'd love to replicate that on sunday evening,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-06,2022,81,1,0,1,is it too much to suggest that those who are the most protective of the pga tour are trying to prove it on the golf course right now with their playing,i don't think so i just think it so happens that the most protective of the pga tour are the best players in the world right now i'm not going out to try to prove anything to anyone i'm in a good run of form i'm playing well whether that gives me a little more confidence to speak up on certain issues maybe but i'm just going out there trying to play my game and trying to win some more tournaments,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-06,2022,158,1,1,1,MODERATOR,yeah i think it's not lost on me what pga tour events do to or what they can do for the communities that they're played in you look at somewhere like here the community supports this event really well in hartford and in return i think the charitable dollars that are raised is really really important you look at somewhere like dublin ohio when jack started the memorial tournament i don't know people maybe lived in dublin ohio and now it's i mean he's basically built a town around a golf tournament so when you think about pga tour events and what they can do for communities this is a good example memorial's a good example and obviously a number of others but i think that's not lost on the players that when they come and play pga tour events they're helping to do something really good in the community that they're playing and i think that's important,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-06,2022,96,1,0,1,i wanted to ask your opinion on the proposed new fall series and everything that's going on with that what do you think would be best for the pga tour to do in that portion of the schedule,i mean i think i would like to see and i've always advocated for something where the tours work more closely together or we create some sort of world tour model or atp model where there's different events going on in different areas of the world but they're all governed under one umbrella so i mean i would like to see the pga tour and the european tour start to work more closely together and maybe try to forge a path to where all the biggest golf events in the world are under the same umbrella,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-06,2022,22,0,1,1,you've sort of become the moral compass of the professional game and all this energy and rhetoric around the tour versus liv does that inspire you to want to make a statement with your golf clubs,not really it's been eight years since i won a major and i just want to get my hands on one again,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-06,2022,90,1,0,1,it's obvious you want to get off to a good start which is something you hadn't done much in majors before the pga last month how does it change things when you're able to do that,yeah it does you feel like you're right in the tournament from the start of the week which is nice i'm going into tomorrow with the mindset of let's keep it going rather than where is the cut line or whatever if you don't get off to a great start those thoughts start to creep in okay what do i need to just be here for the weekend it's certainly a different mindset when you get off to a good start and yeah i've just got to keep it going,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-06,2022,45,0,1,1,since you have been described as the conscience of your sport how do you feel about being placed on that kind of pedestal,i'm just being me i'm living my life i'm doing what i think is right and trying to play the best golf that i possibly can i wasn't asked to be put here i wasn't trying to be in this position i'm just being me,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-06,2022,60,1,0,1,no no no,i guess i took a lot of players' statements at face value i guess that's what i got wrong you had people committed to the pga tour and that's what the statements that were put out people went back on that so i guess i took them for face value i took them at their word and i was wrong,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-06,2022,66,0,1,1,we are at the u s open that liv golf was dead in the water and obviously something has changed since then i'm wondering what do you feel like you got wrong whether it's about state of the game or about your peers to where this thing has more life than initially thought,harry and his wife had their second child last thursday so he got in last night and he'll be on the bag this week niall and i's run has come to an end at this point pretty good record had a fourth in dubai and a first in canada if i ever need someone to jump in for harry i've got a pretty good substitute there,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-06,2022,179,0,1,1,given the historical significance of francis ouimet's victory here and his relationship with his caddie can you talk more about your relationship with harry,it certainly puts a pep in your step it gives you a lot of confidence going into last week even coming off memorial where i didn't have my best week i still knew my game was there i still knew that i was playing well so regardless whether i got i think it was the fashion in which i won last week was what gave me the most pride got a lead early in the back nine lost that lead was tied with two holes to go and then i showed some really good resilience and birdied the last two holes to get the job done i think that the fashion in which i won was what made me the proudest of the victory yeah anytime you follow i did the same thing in going into the u s open at pebble beach and played pretty well there i didn't play well enough to live with gary that week but i feel everything is certainly trending in the right direction and i'm happy with where the game is at,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-06,2022,204,1,0,1,when did it occur to you that you were going to pass greg with a win,because in my opinion it's the right thing to do the pga tour was created by people and tour players that came before us the likes of jack nicklaus arnold palmer they created something and worked hard for something and i hate to see all the players that came before us and all the hard work that they've put in just come out to be nothing i think one of the other things as well is the pga tour has certainly given me a lot of opportunities and i've benefited a lot from that but i think what they've done for charity they've raised if you put all the other major sporting organizations in this country so nfl mlb nba nhl if you put all their charitable dollars combined the pga tour has raised twice as much as that in their history that is a massive legacy and something that i don't think people talk enough about so when you are talking about the tour and everything that's happening right now you have to see the bigger picture than just the golf and i think i've tried to take a wider view of everything and i just think it's the right thing to do,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-06,2022,171,1,0,1,you've really emerged as the leader of the pro pga tour faction why have you taken that mantle of leadership,yeah of course i do i think everything that's happening with this tour it legitimatizes their place in the world and i'm not saying i'm sure not every saudi arabian is a bad person we're talking about this in such a generalized way i've spent a lot of time in the middle east and the vast majority of people that i've met there are very very nice people but there's bad people everywhere the bad people that came from that part of the world did some absolutely horrendous things of course i understand where these families are coming from and in this day and age everything is just so intertwined and it's hard to separate sport from politics from dirty money from clean money it's a very convoluted world right now i certainly empathize with those families and i can't imagine i have friends that have lost people in and it's a really tragic thing i empathize with those families and i certainly understand their concerns and frustrations with it all,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-06,2022,69,0,1,1,as you probably are aware the families have sent not one well they've sent one scathing letter to phil and four other u s players playing in the liv tour and then they replied to phil's non answer yesterday with another scathing statement obviously it's related to the saudis and the saudis' involvement in do you understand the families' point of view,i'm not sure if they're totally i don't think they're complicit in it in a way i think look they all have the choice to play where they want to play and they've made their decision my dad said to me a long time ago once you make your bed you lie in it and they've made their bed that's their decision and they have to live with that,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-06,2022,80,1,0,1,then just a quick follow up him and billy andrade recently announced the end of the cvs charity classic which you came once and played,yeah and going back to what i was talking about with the pga tour and charity that cvs charity classic raised a lot of money for the community there in rhode island i think fax and billy did a great job with that i don't know the details behind why it's not going to be a thing anymore but they had a great run and they raised a lot of money and they should be proud of what they did,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-06,2022,234,1,1,1,rory as this liv golf thing develops can you see two different factions emerging in the locker rooms as the dust settles over this how do you think it's going to strain or impact some of the relationships and friendships you've developed over the years,i don't think it gave me motivation look i talked about going out there on sunday and trying to get my st win and all that a little bit petty i guess in a way but yeah did it help me win or help me keep a level of intensity up probably no i don't think what was happening in london gave me any more motivation i wanted to go there and play well like i do every week i got hot on the weekend and it was nice to get a victory recruitment wise everyone is their own person out here and they have their own goals and their own beliefs my goals i've realized are a lot different than some other people's goals out here again that's fine everyone is different and they make their own decisions based on what they feel is right for themselves so i don't feel i need to recruit anyone i'm not i don't work for the pga tour they work for me people make their own decisions and for me my schedule and where i play and having the ability to pick and choose the courses i want to go to and what's going to give me the best chance to be successful and build on my career build on my legacy it's nice to have all those options open to be able to choose from,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-06,2022,6,1,0,1,rory i was wondering considering the timing of last week and canada going up against their debut did that light a little motivational fire maybe under you to play well that week opposite that do you find yourself at all recruiting some of your peers to stay with the pga tour right now in conversations and things like that,of course it is from you,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-06,2022,174,1,1,1,rory this is a little bit of a devil's advocate question regarding liv,you've got three of the four major championships that are in the united states the travel gets increasingly more difficult going back and forth to give yourself the best chance to further your career in terms of wins and legacy and trying to win major championships america was the place to be i don't think it was all to do with prize money it certainly wasn't guaranteed you had to show up and play well to earn it that's the other thing right i didn't renew my pga tour membership in and i was talking about it last night it was a big regret of mine i sat at home and watched the players championship honestly on bad advice i think that's the thing i have now surrounded myself with good honest hardworking people that are trying to do the right thing for the game of golf if you want to be one of the best players in the world this is the country where you need to play the majority of your golf,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-06,2022,176,1,1,1,i know the circumstances are much different but years ago a lot of the european tour players came over to the pga tour because the money was bigger and whatnot are there any parallels there to some degree even though there's no history to liv,yeah i think the start of my career was probably more feast or famine in the majors i would get hot and win or i would miss the cut by laughing a little more consistency going on but again that doesn't bring with it the glory that the wins do i'm getting back there though my last two showings in major championships have been pretty good that run at augusta and then the start at southern hills was a very welcome one considering the starts i've had previously in major championships so i'm getting back to a place where i'm feeling a lot more comfortable with my game and a lot more comfortable at the biggest it's not really the biggest championships in the world it's more the biggest and toughest tests in the world i think my game is now at place where i feel confident going to these golf courses that are set up more difficult than everyday tour events and knowing that i have the game and the mentality to succeed on them,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-06,2022,145,0,1,1,i just have one more related if you don't mind back on the main event of course which is liv friendships aside is there any part of you as a player that looks at those joining as not so much surrendering but almost recognizing they're not going to be as competitive or can't be as competitive and do you lose respect for that sorry,as a golfer no i think his he won a major championship months ago probably one of the crowning achievements of his career and one of the most impressive achievements in the history of the game of golf as a golfer i have the utmost respect for phil i've been disappointed with how he has went about what he has done but i think he has come back and shown some remorse about how he has handled some things so i think he has learned from that who am i to sit up here and give phil a lesson on how to do things he has had a wonderful career he is his own man he is a great addition to the field this week am i disappointed he has taken the route that he has taken i am but i still respect him tremendously,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-06,2022,203,1,0,1,MODERATOR,and one more than norman yeah it means an awful lot i feel like it's getting tougher and tougher to win on the pga tour even just look at the two guys that i played with today i went out with a lead and had to shoot under par to get the job done so the depth of talent on this tour is really really impressive and going up against guys like jt and tony and coming out on top that's something to feel really good about so super happy to get that st win to defend even though it doesn't feel like a defense because it's been so long and then just to play in a final group like that with that atmosphere all day i mean the fans here this week have just been absolutely unbelievable like so good and so cool to play in an atmosphere like that boisterous loud but respectful it was really really cool it was really cool to be a part of and just really happy to get the win today and obviously sets me up well going into next week in boston but right now i just want to enjoy this and focus on this,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-06,2022,157,1,0,1,you've accomplished almost everything in the game is there a feeling that this win on this very strange and now important week in the world of golf might end up being a bigger part of your legacy than you would have expected before you made the trip to canada,yeah i wanted it a lot i wanted it at the start of the day and there was a few different incentives in there i've been up against jt quite a bit in the past and he's gotten the better of me a couple of times so i knew i had to play really good to beat him tony as well tony played incredible golf today too so that was a big part of it i think going up against the best and beating the best is always makes it extra special and then look i alluded to it i had extra motivation of what's going on across the pond the guy that's spear heading that tour has wins on the pga tour and i was tied with him and i wanted to get one ahead of him and i did so that was really cool for me just a little sense of pride on that one,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-06,2022,123,0,1,1,on how close was your ball going into the deep rough because seems like there was some good fortune there justin obviously goes a bit right he gets a tough lie you go in the left rough but stay in the first cut and obviously that was the difference in the tournament,yeah so jt is a tough competitor but he's also a really really good friend of mine and i have probably more respect for him than maybe anyone else out here just because we both live in south florida we practice so much together and i see how much how hard he works at his craft i appreciate that and i respect that it's always cool to be able to go up against the best and come out on top and yeah we had that embrace on the final green and i just said let's do this all again next week that's what i said to him so that would be cool to be able to do it all over again with him,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-06,2022,157,1,0,1,in hindsight the up and down on given how well things have been tracking and then the first bogey of the day comes along on that up and down on in hindsight right now seems like a pretty big deal,yeah it does it gives you a lot of confidence to know that just to see where your game stacks up against the best jt's coming off winning his second major at the pga championship he's won i think times on tour he's done a lot in the game tony as well like tony's struggled a little bit the last sort of six to months but he seems to have really turned it around he had a good finish at colonial had another good finish here so to go up against guys that are not just the best players in the world but best players in the world playing somewhat near their best and coming out on top that it can only give you confidence so yeah and i guess for me just some of the shots that i hit coming down the stretch those are things to certainly build on going into the next few weeks,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-06,2022,5,1,0,1,the pga tour and the canadian open afford the media such incredible access it's been awesome to see you guys up close what don't we see after this what are the hours like after you win something like this assuming we can't follow you to where you're going next these passes don't get us that far but maybe talk a little bit about what the next few hours will look like that we won't see,would that have been me,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-06,2022,98,1,1,1,can i just get your reaction to the pga tour's decision to suspend the liv players,i think at this point jay's been pretty transparent in terms of he's just going to act within the tournament regulations and the rules that are set for a pga tour member all he's doing is basically going by the book i think that the majority of the membership that are here this week and that haven't went and played elsewhere really appreciate that so i think he's done the right thing because these guys have broken rules and done things outside of the tournament regulations and because of that there are going to be consequences i guess,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-06,2022,211,0,1,1,MODERATOR,yeah it would be nice to keep that percentage up this week for sure yeah it's great to be back in canada first and foremost it's obviously been awhile since this championship's been played i think everyone i've spoken to everyone that i've seen out on the golf course is really excited for the canadian open to be back and just for live sporting events in general to be back on in this country so yeah excited to be back excited to finally defend my title from three years ago at hamilton and yeah wonderful memories from that week i was playing really well coming into it got myself in another position after the saturday night and then just really took advantage of that position on sunday and sort of went out with the mindset of being aggressive and really trying to take the tournament by the scruff of the neck i guess and i was able to do that it was a really fun day i had a chance to shoot there on the back nine which was really cool it's not a position you find yourself in very often so it was just some great memories some great golf played and certainly one of the highlights of for me,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-06,2022,314,1,1,1,MODERATOR,i think my stance on it has been pretty clear from the start it's not something that i want to participate in i certainly understand the guys that have went i understand what their goals and their ambitions are in their life i'm not certainly not knocking anyone for going it's their life it's their decision they can live it the way they want to but for me i want to play on the pga tour against the best players in the world and i think for me speaking to a few people yesterday and one of the comments was anything any decision that you make in your life that's purely for money usually doesn't end up going the right way obviously money is a deciding factor in a lot of things in this world but if it's purely for money it's not never seems to you know it never seems to go the way you want it to and i've had that before a couple of times in my life and there's other things that are a part of it too but it's a weird time in professional golf and i said it a couple weeks ago we're just going to have to see how this season plays out and if any other guys decide to go another direction than the established tours i guess and see what the i guess see what the consequences are but i guess for me right now i can only speak personally it's not something that i envision ever doing i'm happy playing on the pga tour and i have a nice schedule that i can pick for myself i can spend a lot of time at home with my family if i want to prioritize the majors and yeah there's nothing about my schedule or my life or my earning or anything that i would change,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-06,2022,189,0,1,1,if you wouldn't mind i would like to address the elephant in the room the saudi backed liv tour that will start at the same time as this canadian open there are some big names that have been confirmed just in the last few days even the last few hours what do you make of it what do you make of the fuss that's being made about it,i think if it was that easy i would do it more often i guess sometimes you just find yourself in these whether it be these mental states or this place where everything sort of matches up the mental state physically you're in a good place you're swinging it well having the confidence to play the shots and take the shots on you're always i think out on tour we're never i mean very very rarely maybe that day in hamilton maybe the last round at augusta that we're operating on a hundred percent there's always or percent lacking in one area or another and you're always having to fight against it and you're always having to manage your game whether it be physically or mentally and trying to clear negative thoughts or whatever it may be so the days that come along that you are operating at a hundred percent it's nice and you have to take advantage of those but i would say more often than not there's you know you just have to make due with that or percent and get the most out of that,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-06,2022,106,1,0,1,you've spoken before about how important national opens are to you maybe rehash a bit why they're important to you and do you think that that's one of the reasons you something you can only find on the pga tour and is there a reason maybe some of your peers don't see them in the same light you do,i would rather that than the alternative everyone says oh you must get so sick of taking photos with everyone and i said well it beats no one asking for a photo i guess i like it i've worked hard to get to this position and yeah i mean if i didn't like the attention i would go and i would play another sport or i would get another job or whatever but there's a lot of things that come along with being one of the top players in the game and yeah i do relish it i like that i like being in that position,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-06,2022,19,1,1,1,i'll keep this a bit lighter than a liv golf follow up question i saw a couple weeks ago on social media you had a great post with your daughter at the pga championship where she pointed at your picture and said that's when daddy was good which i found was funny so what do you think your daughter would think if daddy manages to repeat here this week,i didn't i was playing in the rain at glen abbey yesterday but they did my wife and daughter,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-06,2022,202,1,0,1,in getting to know rbc the last two or three years since you won at hamilton just wondering how impressed you are by the depth of their involvement in golf at all levels including the professional game,i mean i understand why they i maybe don't understand why they chose this date i understand why they chose the location it's sort of goading the pga tour into allowing releases for that event it's not in the united states it's a conflicting event but we get releases for conflicting events there's a lot of things that they have done that don't make sense to me so no i can't it's very hard for me to put myself in their mind and think things through logically and get to the place where they have gotten to i guess so no yeah again for the game in general i think it's just it's a shame that it's going to fracture the game i think if anything we need to make this the professional game is the window shop into golf if the general public are confused about who is playing where and what tournament's on this week and who is you know oh he plays there okay and he doesn't get into these events it just becomes so confusing i think everything needs to try to become more cohesive and i think it was on a pretty good trajectory until this happened,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-06,2022,179,0,1,1,can you weigh in on liv golf deciding to start its schedule this week opposite one of the oldest golf tournaments in the world that's had a two year absence that you're the defending champion at,yeah so i think there's a few different aspects to why i think the date change has helped i think a lot of guys like playing the week before a major championship now so i think that really helps i think the rotation of golf courses that this event seems to have going hamilton and then here and then i think oakville maybe next year is that right old traditional setups that probably in some way are good preparation for next week it's not all just about next week obviously it's a huge tournament in its own right and you want to come here and compete and try to win but the date change definitely helps and then i think going back to the rbc question i think just their involvement in the game being more present throughout the tour guys getting to know rbc and the team at hilton head and then obviously here as well i think it's a big part of it i think you'll continue to see this field be very strong in the future,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-06,2022,237,0,1,1,with the liv field being announced last night were you surprised disappointed at some of the names and in your opinion does the tour have to drop the hammer in terms of discipline to prevent guys from going in the future,what i turned pro i was playing for money i wanted to keep my card i remember i remember i played the spanish open in as an amateur and the year before one of my really good friends in amateur golf oliver fisher had turned pro and got his european tour card and we went out for dinner one night in madrid and before going out for dinner i looked at the european tour order of merit it and saw he made grand that year and i was like oh my god grand that's unbelievable the guy is loaded i think at the start of course we turn professional to earn a living playing golf like when i turned pro i didn't i was nowhere near getting in majors i was nowhere near playing at the top level of professional golf i hoped to be there one day but like all i wanted to do was get my tour card make a living playing golf yeah like first thing i did when i got my tour card was buy myself a house you need a job and you need to make money to buy yourself a house there's a lot of different parts to this do i play golf for money now no my situation has changed over the years but when i started playing the game professionally yeah money was at the top of the list,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-06,2022,66,1,0,1,after your great start the last day of the pga how low did you think you had to get on sunday and if you had the luxury of knowing that under was going to be in a playoff how would that have maybe changed the way you played the last eight or nine holes,yeah it was about pounds and i remember like i remember they were giving mortgages out this is write before the crash so like i put percent down and like interest only repayment i got it for free basically like everyone else back at that time but yeah it was like pounds so i don't know what that would equate to in dollars back then maybe,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-06,2022,20,0,1,1,curious about the money you were chasing as an year old when you bought that house how much was it do you remember,my mum and dad actually live in it it's the house that they live in whenever they are back home,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-06,2022,103,1,0,1,on the saudi thing i don't know to what degree you've talked to some of the people you're close with but do you get any sense that they still want to play the pga tour,i think with the way this golf course is being tweaked over the years is just hit it in the middle of green two putts take your three and run to the th tee i guess you really want to take a club that if you do pull it a touch you cover that water on the left but really yeah you play to the sort of front third of that green and you know you avoid the water and you yeah middles of the greens here especially with how small some of the targets are like is always going to be good,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-06,2022,104,1,0,1,one quick follow to that what do you consider the most important putt you've ever made in your career,it's hard because i think some of the most important putts could be like i putted from feet on the ninth hole on friday night at quail hollow to make the cut before going and shooting to win my first pga tour event like that was a massive putt you had just as much chance of putting that as i had of putting it i putted it and ended up going on to win my first pga tour event those are moments that i guess no one will really remember apart from me and i think they are some of the most important ones,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-05,2022,257,1,0,1,MODERATOR,yeah so friday i did a little video with gil that they sent out there i don't know was it a week or two so i watched that then i think golf digest had like a few flyovers of the golf course so just tried to get online i tried to dig up some footage of last year's senior pga but it was pretty limited yeah i just tried to sort of see going back to ' it's a completely different golf course so i didn't think that was any use just tried to find some stuff online just to get a feel for what the golf course was like and what gil tried to do with it and what sort of philosophy he was trying to use and what sort of shots he wanted guys to try to play just did a little bit of digging online and it sort of seemed pretty apparent that this is an approach shot and short game like iron play and chipping is going to be really important this week and i think getting out there yesterday one of the things i loved is the way they've cut the runoffs it's very hard to putt from off the greens they're trying to get wedges in guys' hands which i really like it's forcing you to chip instead of just like whenever pinehurst was you could putt from sort of everywhere where this is actually forcing you to get a wedge in your hand which is really good i like that,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-05,2022,81,0,1,1,you said at augusta that you talked about sort of staying in it early on in a major to kind of make your way into potentially winning it and yet all four of your wins have been kind of from out in front early on how do you kind of reconcile those two things with getting out to a big lead versus as a more experienced golfer trying to stay in it,no not really has it been six weeks or so since augusta six weeks is a long enough time to recover from that week and then build yourself back up again he certainly hasn't chosen two of the easiest walks in golf to come back to augusta and here but no he's stubborn he's determined this is what he lives for he lives for these major championships and if he believes he can get around holes he believes he can win,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-05,2022,95,1,0,1,you mentioned we're going to have to see how this shakes out and reshapes professional golf is there a good clean resolution at this point is there something that you're rooting for,i think it's a clean slate i was actually hitting balls beside tom gillis at the bear's club over the weekend and he played the senior pga here last year so he gave me a couple little things to look out for or maybe a couple of greens to spend extra time on stuff like that i think ' was a completely different golf course that you'd really just want to talk to the guys that played here last year in the senior pga to get a better feel of how the golf course plays,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-05,2022,137,1,0,1,we saw you out with brad faxon yesterday what were you working on with brad,in fairness the pac is fine because it's a very high overview of what's going on and there's four or five meetings a year being on the board is different and there's maybe a few more calls that i've been on than i would have expected to be on whenever i took the role up yeah again that ignorance is bliss it's nice to be in the know but at the same time it's nice not to know look i'm trying to do the right thing for the pga tour and the pga tour members because that's what i was elected to do so i'm trying to do that to the best of my ability but there's people on that board that are a lot smarter than i am that are going to make the ultimate decision,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-04,2022,21,0,1,1,nice,four hand warmers i'm getting soft i've been living in florida for too long now so this is cold for me,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-04,2022,191,1,0,1,i was just wondering how yesterday's practice round pairing came together i think it was you padraig shane and seamus and if there's anything new you can learn from playing augusta national at this point,yeah it didn't really shane and i spend a lot of time together down in jupiter now that he and his family have moved down there so we organized that game last week then he texted me and said seamus is going to join us and that was great and then padraig as well i actually didn't know padraig was in the field which is bad laughter but i guess he played pretty well in the pga last year yeah so it was really good fun shane and i and padraig are going to play on the par tomorrow as well so that will be good fun you know the club here it always is making little tweaks and improvements to the golf course so there's always something to learn the reason that i came up here a little bit early last week was just to see the couple of changes is basically a new golf hole is a little bit different then the three new greens and all with subtle little tweaks to the slopes there yeah you're always learning around this golf course i don't think that ever changes,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-04,2022,114,0,1,1,rory for quite a lot of people out there and indeed for some of the people in here this is the first time back for a few years you've been here how does this week feel to you now you're in a very special position to tell us,yeah it feels like we're back to normal life i guess it feels like a normal masters again it feels like we're sort of over the we're sort of at the light at the end of the tunnel i guess is the way i would put it was a very strange masters ' with some limited fans was much better and this year the crowds for a monday yesterday were amazing even driving up berckmans road it took us what is a minute drive usually it took us minutes to get to the club yesterday morning so everyone's excited to just get back out and live their lives again and it's great to see,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-03,2022,98,0,1,1,obviously there's an incredible prize for this week up again do you think golfers are fairly remunerated do they earn too much where are you on that,i think we're paid as much as people are willing to pay us i guess you can say the same thing about footballers or any other athletes it's like you could argue that they're paid too little or too much but you're only worth what people are willing to pay you i'd say at this point we're pretty fairly we're fairly paid the top guys earn a lot of money and i think that's right even the guys that are not at the top they still earn a really really good living i think it's a good structure,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-03,2022,258,0,1,1,i just want to ask you one question and you've been asked this a couple times really tonight or today in the bigger picture what has tiger woods meant to the game of golf,not totally everything but i think the game of golf is going to outlive us all there's certainly players in the history of the game that they leave their mark more than others tiger's left more of a mark on this game i think than anyone else basically in the history especially since golf has become a profession and professional golfers have become sort of bigger so i think the fact that he is a person of color and what that brings to the table in terms of golf being a more acceptable sport to play if you're from a certain ethnic background i think that has been that's left a huge mark on the game i certainly think the game is more diverse because of him and just his play in general and the excitement he created around the game of golf he was i'd say in his pomp in early s he was probably the most famous man in the world we as his colleagues and peers we've all benefited from that he made golf professional golf at the highest level a very very attractive thing to be involved in tv paid more sponsors paid more and then all of a sudden his peers and colleagues and other players were getting paid more because of that i think we all have to be very thankful for tiger woods and when he came along and we should all be very fortunate that we played at a time that he was around because we've all benefited from him,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-03,2022,155,1,0,1,you and many others in the golf world have all weighed in on phil in the last couple weeks moving forward now how long do you think it's really going to take for this to blow over and for phil to get back in the good graces of the golf world because plenty of good athletes have had their pr blunders but nothing lasts forever,i think well everything you've got all these tvs in here you've got coverage of it i think the changes to the golf course the aesthetics of it sort of the setup the agronomy just the whole feel of the place i mean you drive in here and you have that big grand clubhouse it feels special it feels like a special event it feels like a special week it has it has got bigger and better most years i think there's a lot of thought and a lot of new ideas that are brought to the table for this event this is where the pga tour can showcase what they have so i think just all of that in general obviously the prize fund is huge and that's great but there's a lot of other things that go into the event to make it feel the way it is and make it feel special,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-03,2022,179,1,0,1,when you were saying sunday that it's a course that made you maybe feel like you were playing worse than you actually were i assume that was mostly condition related are there actually courses that can do that to you,yeah so i played ' and ' and missed the cut both times and then i actually skipped this event in ' actually i gave up my pga tour membership in ' too yeah and i don't there was a couple i was influenced by certain things or certain people and that's what sort of led to that decision but then came back and it was always as i said my relationship with this tournament has definitely changed over the years i don't feel like the tour pushed the fifth major name in any way it's just sort of what became of it but it certainly has it's got bigger and better every year they've done a wonderful job with it it's been i think all the players would agree with that yeah it's certainly one of the from the start of my career where it wasn't one of my favorites it's certainly up there in at least the top half dozen that i want to play and want to make sure that my game is in shape for,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-03,2022,8,0,1,1,we talked about a few minutes ago do you ever before or after you've hit your second shot on do you look ahead to see what the flight path is of the balls that are coming off of tee,yes alex i don't live in a cave,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-03,2022,198,1,0,1,i figured that bottom line is the pga tour unlike many sports organizations including the r a haven't made a statement yet i think there's going to be maybe something coming out today but one of the issues is that some of the major sponsors involved with the pga tour have not stopped doing business in russia do you have a thought on what the tour should or shouldn't do in these situations,i think growing the business of the tour i think the tv deal the domestic rights deal that the pga tour did a year or so ago was incredible like the business side of the tour had everything to do with putting more money in players' pockets i think he's done a fantastic job i think the one thing that the tour in general could do a better job at is transparency whether that be with yeah just with everything i think transparency and maybe it not being as closed a shop i've always felt that a few of the bans or suspensions i think that should all be announced i think that should be more transparent i've always said that but that's something i'm sure they're working on and have constant dialogue in but i'd say overall jay has done a wonderful job in terms of weathering the storm of the pandemic putting more money in guys' pockets making this tour the best tour in the world to play on you're only sort of picking holes if you're really trying to have any negatives but overall he's done him and his team have done a great job,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-03,2022,295,0,1,1,a couple weeks ago at riviera you said that the saudi breakaway tour was dead do you still feel that way,best than most that's funny the first time i ever watched tiger play golf was his i think it was his ' u s amateur win or maybe ' anyways he was a big deal when he was an amateur and obviously he won three u s amateurs in a row and turned pro with a lot of hype so that was the first time i watched him play then yeah i met him i went first to watch him play in at mount juliet in the wgc i think it was like the american express back then then yeah i met him when i was or for the first time and then i think i feel very fortunate because there is this sort of saying that you shouldn't meet your heroes and tiger was my hero when i met him and he lived up to expectations he's been nothing but unbelievable to me and my family and yeah he's been awesome and he's been an inspiration for so many of us that are out here playing this golf tournament this week and to see him inducted into hall of fame which is obviously like a no like of course he was going to be a hall of famer when he was five years old yeah it's really cool it's cool that he's here it's cool that it's happening and yeah i think he's at a stage in his life where he probably appreciates all this a little bit more at this point and yeah i always say we all that are playing here this week have to thank tiger for where the game is and where the tour is i'm pretty sure it's going to be a pretty nice turnout for him tomorrow night,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-03,2022,123,1,0,1,MODERATOR,yeah it's always good to be back at bay hill i didn't play this event for the first few years of my career and finally came here in and i don't think i've missed a tournament since we all know what arnold palmer means to the pga tour and to the game of golf in general so it's always nice to be here and try to sort of remember his legacy and remember what he meant to everyone he was probably the catalyst with maybe a few other guys of why we're here today and why the game of professional golf is at such a high level so nice to be here nice to pay our respects looking forward to another good week,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-03,2022,162,1,0,1,rory given your stature and success in the game it gives you a voice do you feel though that even if you weren't a world renowned golfer you would still speak out about injustices you see and why are you that way,look i'll only voice my opinion on things that i believe i'm educated in and believe that i have a right to talk about so there's certainly things that i won't get into just because i'm not completely educated on that topic and feel like giving an opinion probably isn't the right thing to do but when it comes to golf and pga tour stuff i feel like i'm pretty educated on that stuff and i guess with that voice comes responsibility to try to do the right thing that's all i try to do i try to make comments or speak about things to do the right thing and that's the reason i'm maybe a little more outspoken than other guys in our game again it doesn't go much further than the game of golf because i feel comfortable talking about that but when you sort of delve into other things i don't think it's my place to get into that,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-03,2022,185,1,0,1,one more golf question finchem probably back in ' had talked about this idea of somewhat of a world tour schedule and also how difficult it would be to put together they've been trying for a long time do you get a sense that given the dynamics of golf right now that it could be getting closer to that and that it would still be just as difficult to implement,so i certainly think there's been steps taken that have got us closer to that point obviously this strategic alliance between dp world tour and the pga tour pga tour buying a stake in european tour productions jay having a seat on the board in europe they're certainly working much closer together which is a great thing i think it needs to be that way the game of professional golf everyone needs to be trying to pull in the same direction instead of pulling against each other i think we're getting closer to that spot i think it would be easy for it's not as simple as this but the guys at the pga tour could just literally walk down the street to the guys in the atp and just have a chat about what they do it's two very very different structures and different schedules but i think there is a path where one day there could be it might still be two tours running side by side parallel to each other but basically for it would be a global tour a global schedule,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-03,2022,61,1,0,1,would it be important for europe's identity,i think so i think there's quite a long history and tradition and heritage there you go back to yeah the formation of the european tour wasn't that long after the pga tour i think european tour was in the ' s and pga tour was in the late ' s so there's history there that you would like to keep,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-03,2022,51,0,1,1,rory to doug's point about your schooling i think the headmaster at sullivan told me years ago that you scored on your sat,yeah but that's yeah i was going to say something i'm not even going to go there that's fine something like that yeah i did take the sat to get into college over here in america then i thought better of it and decided that i wanted to make money sooner,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-03,2022,86,0,1,1,i know you to be a student of the world and what's going on and you've traveled all over the world the world is such a tender place right now what do you do to sort of put that aside so you can focus on your day job,i try to look at the news once a day and sort of leave it at that you sort of try to keep up to date with current events and everything that's happening i guess i have to understand that sitting in my position right here in orlando florida there's not much that i can say or do that's going to help the situation so i can just focus on what's most important to me which is my family and my golf and live my life,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-03,2022,362,1,0,1,rory do you think all pga tour players should take a turn being a member of the players advisory council do you think that would be a good benefit for everyone's understanding of how the business of the tour operates,yeah i think so like i've been a member of the pac now for a few years and worked my way up to the policy board this year and for the next few years yeah it's been an education for me i certainly know a lot more about tour business now than i did before i started it gives you an appreciation it gives you an appreciation for how hard everyone back in ponte vedra works all the things they do for pga tour members the pension plan deferred compensation it's the best structure in sports for a league of athletes or members yeah it's just been a real education i think the more people that want to get involved in it and learn about it it's just i think it would be very beneficial i don't think it should be something that should be forced upon the players but i think maybe the tour doing a better job or being more forthright or whatever i think having two or three mandatory player meetings a year maybe isn't quite enough to get the points across that they want to get across i think that's the other thing for pga tour members they have to realize that the pga tour executives and everyone that works back in ponte vedra they work for us and they're trying to do the best job for the members of the tour and all the net revenues flow to us but at the same time we have to keep them accountable and make sure they're doing a good job from what i've seen over the last few years they handled the pandemic well probably better than most other leagues did they came out of that financially very very strong probably was their best ever year in terms of financials there's more and more revenues flowing to the players each and every year i feel like they're doing a really good job i would be the first one to put my hand up and say if they weren't but right now i appreciate the job that they're doing i hope most people on the pga tour appreciate that too,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-01,2022,266,1,0,1,went to the range after the round yesterday did you find something,a little bit golf is sort of a game of opposites the more you try to get the club out in front of you on the way back the for it wants to try to get behind you on the way down i've been trying so hard to keep the club in front of me that it started to get behind me coming down i got underneath a few of them today but it was better just turning on to trying to keep the club on plane on the way down and then i can basically hit it with my body rotation especially with my hands i thought i hit my irons a lot better today and was in control of the driver a bit better too with how i ended last year i certainly found something got a bit of momentum won on the pga tour had a really good chance to win here in dubai at the end of last season it feels good there's so many ebbs and flows in this game and the career is so long that it's sort of hard to compare one year to the next and how you're feeling and how you're hitting it but i think looking back on my last years or whatever it's been the body of work is there and i've played well and i haven't felt so good and i played poorly when i felt really good it's just a matter of keep showing up each and every day and try to putt the lowest score possible on the scorecard and move on,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-01,2022,56,0,1,1,personally how special is it to come back here knowing it's the place where you won for the very first time,a lot of good memories here played as an amateur got to world no amateur after playing pretty well in i lived in dubai for four years as well i've got good memories here have a lot of close friends from this region it's a very comfortable place for me and it's nice to be back,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-01,2022,74,1,0,1,you mentioned tiger and you mentioned mount juliet there just wondering are you planning to come over and play the irish open at mount juliet this year and would you like to see that event co sanctioned by the pga tour in the future,i'd love to see it co sanctioned by the pga tour in the future i think that would be obviously a wonderful thing for the event i haven't made my decision yet i know i'm playing a lot of golf in the states around that time of year memorial canada u s open travelers yeah we'll see and i honestly haven't made that decision yet but whenever i do i'll certainly let you know,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-01,2022,217,1,0,1,what memories have you got of seamus power as an amateur from your amateur days and what have you made of what he's achieved over the last year,yeah he's played great seamus has done it a very different way than a lot of us have done it in terms of going to college in the states and then basically staying over there and doing everything on the pga tour but he's done fantastically well he's played really well the last i mean the last year really last six months he's really excelled and he's edging towards the top in the world i'm not sure i think he is in the top this week which is an amazing achievement there's so many avenues or ways to do it but for him to it on the toughest tour in the world and the deepest fields he's done it the hard way i guess and he's done it really really well i'm happy for him i remember being in the irish under panel with seamus i remember playing the i remember playing the munster under s with him and it was at wasn't at west waterford it was like gold coast or something like that but yeah i mean i've known seamus for going on years at this point so i'm happy for him happy that he's playing so well and it will be great to see him play in some of those bigger events this year,0
rory mcilroy,0,2022-01,2022,136,1,0,1,just from your standpoint as we start the calendar year how would you assess the health of european golf and what used to be called the european tour,honestly i don't think it's ever been in a healthier position i think the alliance with the pga tour is massive i think the young players that are coming through you know you think about the if you're thinking of the tour you think of the fact that the first american ever won the race to dubai year in collin morikawa and you have these young players coming through from either side of the pond that want to play over here and travel look i think the one disappointment for every european golf fan was the ryder cup last year but i think it's never been healthier the tournaments are getting bigger sponsorship dollars are coming in to support event players are wanting to come back and play i think it's in a really good spot,0
rory mcilroy,0,2021-11,2021,155,1,0,1,your emotional interview after the singles at the ryder cup had most of europe in tears to be honest you've gone away and made some alterations to how you've looked at things and gone about stuff and been rewarded with a victory already on the pga tour give us an insight into the significance and importance of what you've gone through these last few weeks,yeah i feel i'm a big boy now i've been around the block a bit and if i have problems or struggles i should be able to sort them out myself instead of looks to others to fix my problems i'm going to take responsibility a bit and that's what i did after the ryder cup put my head down and spent a lot of time just on the range and just figuring out okay what is it do i do well and what do i need to get back to i've always been a very visual player i always see shots i don't know how much the shot tracer was out there today but people probably see me playing shots again maybe not quite as much as bubba watson but still that's how i've always played golf and seen the game and i just need to get back to seeing it like that again,0
rory mcilroy,0,2021-11,2021,253,0,1,1,the big talking point of the month has been environmentalism with cop and that sort of thing you're somebody with a massive global footprint you travel in private jets you play a game that some people argue is not the most environmentally friendly i've never heard you speak on that subject what's your take,it's funny you say that so two years ago after i won in china i flew back home privately and it was just me on the plane and i just got this massive sense of guilt come over me just because this can't be good and all that sort of stuff so we ended up reaching out to the geo foundation who do a lot of great sustainability things in golf and that was the only sort of organization that we knew of that i guess could help us go in the right direction what i was trying to do is make all my travel i wouldn't self profess to be an eco warrior but i'm someone that doesn't want to damage the environment anyway so how can i make my travel around the world neutral how can i neutralise what i do and they came up with a few different ways that i can do that so on top of what i pay to fly private i pay quite a bit more on top of that to make sure i'm carbon neutral by the end of the year so it's something that i have a conscience about and i take it seriously especially when you see some of these weather events that are happening and i live in a part of the world where hurricanes are very prevalent and becoming more and more prevalent as the years go on i think we can all play our part in some way or another,0
rory mcilroy,0,2021-11,2021,131,0,1,1,how much of a talking point do you think it is amongst your peers the other players is something that's going to gain momentum,yeah i think yeah as you said we play on big pieces of land that take up a lot of water and a lot of other things that could maybe be put to better use some could argue but at the end of the day we decide to be professional golfers and hit a ball around a course and i guess that's sort of the extent of it but as i said we all can do our part i certainly don't think it's something that i've talked to many of the players about really but just from my conscience and my mind i know that i'm at least when i do travel and i travel privately that i'm not doing it to the detriment of the world that we live in,0
rory mcilroy,0,2021-11,2021,112,0,1,1,just curious rory the dp world tour the new schedule the increased prize money and more focus new sponsor does that change your thinking for and beyond in terms of how you would map out your own schedule,yeah i don't know i live in america that's where i'm going to play the majority of my golf i don't think it will change really it will change schedule for me i just think it's a great thing for this tour that the members that play on this tour full time have a place to play long into the future but for me personally i think i'm just going to play the same schedule that i've basically played for the last sort of five years it may encourage me to add an event here or there for the most part i'll probably keep doing what i've done the last few years,0
rory mcilroy,0,2021-09,2021,251,0,1,1,naomi was talking about inaudible have you ever been there,no because winning it's different in golf right yeah look there's certainly been times when i haven't enjoyed the game as much as i would want to but i think that's still i've tried really hard and i spoke about this quite a lot in about separating who i am as a golfer and who i am as a person and trying to not let that define me and it seems what naomi is going through at the minute is that same thing how can i play tennis and enjoy it and not let the results define who i am i think that's her i think that's what she's going through right now and i think everyone just needs to let her have time to figure that out and she seems like a really smart girl and hopefully she'll be able to do it and come back and start enjoying the game just like when she picked the racquet up when she was a little girl because that's doing it as a job or for a living and that's when the joy goes out of it and that's when you lose your innocence and that's when you lose there's a part of that that goes the further along you get in this professional career and the more you can hold onto that joy and innocence of remembering what it was the reason why you picked up a golf club and why you picked up a tennis racquet that's the important thing,0
rory mcilroy,0,2021-09,2021,100,1,0,1,mcginley for sure,mcginley for sure clarkie a little bit too i think as well like padraig is still pretty competitive he's got a pga tour card he plays over here so i think he more than the last few captains has had to try to balance that i'm going to be a ryder cup captain but i'm still trying to play at a high level and focus on my game a little bit but i think over the last couple of months i've definitely felt more of a switch where he's definitely more in ryder cup mode than he is playing mode,0
rory mcilroy,0,2021-09,2021,240,1,0,1,jon has been kind of outspoken about the format for this week he points out the fact that you come in having won four five times and a major and end up finishing th on the points list and i know you've addressed this before but there is a clarity for the fans but that's offset by jon's point which i think a lot of people agree with do you have a thought on that one way or the other,yeah i mean i look the first year that it was played in this format i started five back and i ended up winning the tournament by three so like everyone gets here the people that have played well have an advantage it's not an insurmountable advantage like it has been in previous years where guys have turned up to the tour championship not having to do anything to win the fedexcup and that's certainly you don't want that to happen either so i mean there's been a few iterations of it and i think this is definitely the best format so far there's clarity for the players there's clarity for the fans it's again it's the playoffs and i think everyone that's in the top deserves to be here and then because of that everyone in the top deserves to feel like they have a chance to win it all so i can certainly see where jon is coming from especially with the year that he's had but look i've went into two i went into two playoff runs being no in and and didn't win either of them so i've been on both sides of the coin here look it is what it is i mean the pga tour wanted to create this playoffs format and by nature it is going to be volatile at the end of the year and i think most players have accepted that,0
rory mcilroy,0,2021-09,2021,84,0,1,1,do you feel like you have to develop a thicker skin for the ryder cup,yeah certainly especially the ones that are played in the united states but i think the best thing is to just not someone once told me awhile back if you don't take anything personally you'll live a very happy life and i think i try to do that all the time you just try to let it slide off not take things personally and if you can do that and if you can train yourself to think that way it certainly makes it easier,0
rory mcilroy,0,2021-08,2021,117,1,0,1,there hasn't been a tournament here in years so i'm wondering in some ways isn't it kind of nice to have a lot of birdies down here people come out here they've been wanting pga tour golf for a long time maybe throwing a ton of birdies at them is a great product,yeah it's exciting i think everyone out on the course enjoyed it today they enjoy watching us try to drive greens and make eagles on par s and all that yeah i think for again i said this the other day it depends what we're all trying to get out of the fedexcup playoffs i think one part of it is entertainment it's certainly been entertaining this week i don't think it'll be quite as it won't be the birdie fest next week as it is this week and i think that's a good thing especially when you come to the final one and the top i think the challenge is an important part of it too,0
rory mcilroy,0,2021-08,2021,138,1,0,1,patrick cantlay was just in here talking about the moment he fell in love with golf he talked about it in high school when he could drive to the course do you have a memory of the first time you really kind of got hooked,it was probably too long ago i was sort of hooked from a very young age i always remember like growing up in northern ireland that the pga tour golf was on at nighttime so i remember always going to bed after watching on a saturday and sunday like so inspired watching my idols watching the people i looked up to going to bed on that sunday night so inspired to go out the next day and practice or try to get better but that was from a real early age yeah i mean i would say from what i can remember seven eight nine years old i remember tiger winning the u s amateur i remember watching that even before he turned pro i was loving watching that and playing and practicing and trying to get better,0
rory mcilroy,0,2021-08,2021,141,1,0,1,what's your club stash look like at the house how many clubs are we talking about is this like going into a pga tour superstore,no not at all basically i have from onwards but there's a lot of stuff i just give away or give back but i'm not a hoarder i keep a bunch of shafts that i've tried over the years and a bunch of stuff i have a couple of sets of irons that i've won majors with and that sort of stuff but yeah there is i've got a few things in there and every so often something catches your eye like oh i remember that or i'd like to try that again but in terms of what i can actually play with like current product i don't have that much i sort of try to keep it to a minimum because i know if i have too much start i'll just start to tinker and that's not a good thing,0
rory mcilroy,0,2021-07,2021,57,0,1,1,is it a case of you wanted too much or trying too hard,not at all i've got four of them geez look i've got i'm the luckiest guy in the world i get to do what i love for a living i have a beautiful family my life is absolutely perfect at the minute i want for nothing so it's not a case of trying too hard for sure,0
rory mcilroy,0,2021-07,2021,168,0,1,1,related to the first question you've had two years to dwell on what happened in you weren't able to banish the memory last year how much has the fact you missed the cut and it was your home open how much has that lived with you as a monkey on your back,yeah i think so you never want to miss a cut as you say but as missed cuts go this wasn't necessarily a bad one i wasn't planning on playing the scottish open a few weeks ago anyway so just to get a couple of competitive rounds in and just learn a little bit more and figure out what i need to do look it would have been great to stay and play an extra couple days in scotland but to be down here and get a few holes in on saturday play a full round on sunday felt like i got a bit of a head start on the rest of the field which feels good it means now that i didn't even play any holes yesterday i played today i'm probably going to go out early tomorrow and play but i just meant that i can take it a bit easier the next couple days not feel like i'm trying to cram all the preparation in,0
rory mcilroy,0,2021-07,2021,171,1,0,1,you had a very good u s open i'm just wondering would you be happy to play the same as you did in that event this week or was it something about that performance you feel you need to improve on to give yourself another chance at this week,yeah viktor is going to be an instrumental player for the european team for a long time to come i've been really impressed with him and how he's played i played a practice round with him at pebble beach in and he was still an amateur then what he's done already as a pro it's really really impressive yeah he's obviously a great young player he's whatever he is he's got a really bright future and that's yeah having someone like him on the european team can only help he's used to playing in the states obviously a great college career plays most of his golf on the pga tour it's not as if he's going to get overwhelmed by anything over there during the ryder cup i can't remember the conversation that we had but i probably told him if he was trying to choose a partner i'd put my hand up and like to guide him around but yeah i'm looking forward to teaming up with him in september,0
rory mcilroy,0,2021-07,2021,56,0,1,1,pádraig harrington told had he when he first played in the irish open he felt the weight of the crowd how has it been for you,it's been sort of similar in a way it's been a bit of a learning curve for me but definitely feel the support more than the expectation honestly it makes it easier not living here anymore sort of separating myself from it all and coming back and enjoying the week has made a difference as well,0
rory mcilroy,0,2021-06,2021,266,0,1,1,wondering about your memories of those tournaments in and many champions here are major winners is that something that you feel that this is a course that maybe suits players of that calibre that you should be up there this week because of that,yeah i hope so i hope to continue that trend that's for sure yeah i remember quite a bit i said to harry the last time i was on the th green here was during the prize ceremony when tiger won and i remember i somehow sneaked my way like under the rope onto the back of the green and i was standing right behind him and his glove was still in his back pocket and like i could have reached and got it and ran it would have been a good story to tell him but i obviously didn't it was the first time i ever watched tiger play live i remember the first shot i ever saw him hit was a drive off the th hole the par and he hit a iron into the green it was really cool i idolised him growing up and to actually see the man in the flesh was pretty exciting and then in i was sort of i had sort of made a name for myself in the amateur scene at that point and i had gotten to know chubby and darren and stuff so i was a little more in the i remember being in the clubhouse and stuff and meeting ernie after he won had a little more access then because that have but yeah really good memories coming down here watching it's amazing that it's been years and the tournament hasn't been back since glad to be back and certainly a lot's changed in the last years since the last time i was here,0
rory mcilroy,0,2021-06,2021,186,1,0,1,on a similar note what do you make of the restrictions coming up for the open at sandwich obviously some players are not going to be happy they are probably used to some things slightly easier on the pga tour has it had any impact on your plans,yeah i mean everything's had an impact up until last week my family were going to travel with me and we were going to be here for three weeks my original plan was to play here take a week off that week in between which is now the scottish open and then play the open but just with travel restrictions and obviously with me being exempt as a sports person and the restrictions not maybe being as heavy as they would be for erica and poppy for example i just felt like it wasn't fair to put them through what they would have to go through to be here with me so plans changed very quickly we made the decision that i would travel on my own and because i just i mean i wasn't going to go back to the states for one week in between the irish and the open i thought if i'm here i might as well play the scottish so it sort of went quickly from them coming to them not coming and then me playing three events in a row,0
rory mcilroy,0,2021-06,2021,167,1,0,1,with all due respect it's probably not quite as high quality of a field as previous irish opens do you think that could be because it's not a links course and it's at an awkward stage before the open and the scottish open,yeah it's tough it's tough to go into the open having it be your third week in a row i think a lot of guys feel that you're not going to get many of the international guys coming over to play they are not going to play the irish open and take a week off and then play the open the date it's a better date than we had in may i think but it's probably still not perfect to have a great field you see the field that the scottish open have next week it's very very strong so i don't really know what the answer is it's obviously not as strong as it has been in previous years and there's a few factors to that as well you've got the tournament in detroit on pga tour this week guys just have so many options where to play and when to play some guys are going to make the addition to play here and others aren't,0
rory mcilroy,0,2021-06,2021,178,1,0,1,MODERATOR,yeah it's certainly different when we see it in january for the farmers but it's really good i had my first look at the course yesterday played holes the setup's great it's fair obviously with the dry southern california climate the greens have the possibility to get very firm so i think they've taken that in mind the rough is playable you can hit it in the rough and at least have a chance to get it up around the green and sort of use your short game to scramble and save par it's not as penal as some other u s opens but i think the setup's good it's really fair i've heard nothing but positive praise from a lot of the players it's nice to come to a venue where we all know it pretty well from sort of being on the pga tour schedule there's not really any secrets out there we all know what to do and how to play it and it's just a matter of who can execute over the four days,0
rory mcilroy,0,2021-06,2021,92,1,0,1,with your player advisory committee chairman's hat on can you comment on the reports that greens books are said to be banned on the pga tour,look everything that's talked about in those meetings is somewhat confidential but what i can say i think i use a greens book and i'd like to get rid of them i think everyone is in the same boat most guys on tour are in the same boat that if it's going to be available to us and it helps us people are going to use it but i think for the greater good of the game i'd like to see them be outlawed and for them not to be used anymore,0
rory mcilroy,0,2021-06,2021,28,1,0,1,would you want to ask her which swing she's watching is she watching the quail hollow swing or the pga championship swing,i would like her yeah true i would probably tell her stay away from these swings these are the ones you need to look at but it's cool,0
rory mcilroy,0,2021-06,2021,110,1,0,1,what kind of prompted that actually was wondering as good as you've been for as long as you've been have you ever had to play with a chip on your shoulder,no the only time i felt like i played with a chip on my shoulder it wasn't really a it was sort of more when i was playing behind phil and rickie at the pga in valhalla in i saw them fist bumping coming off the th green together and it sort of felt like a two on one sort of i was like well these guys sort of seem like they're teaming up on me so i'm like you know i'm not going to take that and that sort of gave me a little bit of fire in my belly to go on and play the way i did,0
rory mcilroy,0,2021-05,2021,302,1,0,1,MODERATOR,yeah it's up there it's funny i wasn't playing very well coming into it i think i missed like four of my last six cuts played okay in akron the week before finished like fifth but sort of got here to this course and some weeks you just have a good feeling some weeks you just sort of go with it and it was one of those weeks that it felt good and yeah i got off to a good start i took advantage of the benign conditions on the first day and probably the best round of the week for me was the friday i think the scoring average that day was i think i shot which i was delighted with then obviously played really well over the weekend but yeah it's nine years ago it seems longer it seems like there's been a lot of time that's passed and i feel like i'm a different person and a different player you know it's a different time of year probably going to be a different wind than we played in the last time so it's going to play like a completely different golf course i played great here last time obviously and won my first pga and my second major but just because i did that doesn't mean that i'm going to find it any easier this week than anyone else it's a really tough test especially when the wind is blowing like this those last few holes out there are brutal it's going to be a great test but yeah look i've maybe got some better memories and better vibes here than most of the other guys do and that's obviously nice but not sure it's going to enable me to play any better it is nice to be back,0
rory mcilroy,0,2021-05,2021,144,1,1,1,just curious your thoughts at this point on the olympics it's obviously not going to be the experience that everybody would have hoped and i wonder if that impacts your thinking at all about it we've had some players that have bowed out maybe more for scheduling reasons but still,no it's certainly not going to be the authentic olympic experience that you would normally get but it's the times that we're living in i guess sort of no different than when you go over and play a tournament in asia anyway you see the golf course and the hotel and that's sort of it it's not going to be that much different to what we play when we go over and play the hsbc or zozo or cj cup or whatever yeah it's not ideal but it's still a good opportunity to do something that i've never done before and i'm at least looking forward to this is my th pga championship i've been around now for a long time so it's sort of rare to be able to do something for the first time again i'm sort of looking forward to that,0
rory mcilroy,0,2021-05,2021,63,1,0,1,you talked a bit earlier about the pga championship win but i'm curious from your perspective when you look back at that victory how big was that moment for you winning your second major at that moment in your career,yeah it was huge a lot of guys have won one major but it's a big hurdle to get to the second it was good to get that monkey off my back especially here playing so well so yeah it was a big deal i definitely didn't want to be stuck on one for a long time so happy to get that second,0
rory mcilroy,0,2021-04,2021,166,0,1,1,have you actually gone to see him or have you just kind of talked to him,yeah i went to see him a few i guess it was the sunday before the match play i went over and saw him spent a couple hours with him which was nice it was good to see him it was good to see him in decent spirits and actually not as you know like when you hear of these things and you look at the car and you see the crash it's like you think he's going to be in a hospital bed for six months but he was actually doing better than that a few of us that live down in south florida went to see him i'm sure he appreciates that and again as i said everyone would love to see him back out here again i think myself j t rickie dj brooks all those guys down there we all have a responsibility to try to keep his spirits up and keep him going and try to get him back out here,0
rory mcilroy,0,2021-04,2021,237,1,1,1,as i'm sure you're aware outside of the gates here the state of georgia has been in the news recently for its controversial new voting law and major league baseball just last week pulled the all star game of course out of atlanta with that in mind is your sport doing enough to combat this law especially with the game's stated efforts on diversity and inclusion,i think so i have to be respectful and somewhat careful what i say because i'm not a citizen of this country but i certainly think all great countries and democracies are built on equal voting rights and everyone being able to get to the ballot boxes as easily as possible yeah that's all i can really say about it i thought the pga tour put out a great statement at the start of this week about it all me as a pga tour member and as a golfer we go to a lot of different communities and obviously the tour championship is in atlanta but i think what the pga tour have done with the east lake foundation and the rejuvenation project that's happened in that community in atlanta has been a wonderful thing that the pga tour has been involved with yeah look i'm all for getting people to get out and vote and to have a great democracy and i've chosen to live in this country because i believe this country is the best country in the world and so i you know america is the land of opportunity and it's the american dream you work hard you get rewarded so i believe in all of that stuff but yeah i'm all for people being able to have the right to vote and to be able to do it in the easiest way possible,0
rory mcilroy,0,2021-04,2021,196,0,1,1,you're going to be playing with jon rahm the first two days new father how difficult was that and what advice would you have for him,my first round as a dad i shot so laughter he's got that to live up to i mean he's probably just had the greatest few days of his life right it's such a cool feeling from the reports i hear kelly is doing well and the baby is doing well he can at least come here in a state of mind knowing everything is okay at home and he can concentrate on what he has to do here get a few nights sleep and then obviously go back and be a dad but yeah you're riding high there's so many emotions that are involved but i think jon's an awesome player and he's played well here over the last couple years and i'm sure he's going to handle everything really well i don't feel like that's going to distract him at all i think he's had a great few days and everything's good if you can sort of just keep that mindset going into this week then you know being here and being relaxed and maybe having your mind not fully on augusta and the masters and the green jacket is not a bad thing,0
rory mcilroy,0,2021-03,2021,125,1,0,1,we know when you're home you work on your game a ton out here on the pga tour we don't see you grind and grind on the range all day long like some guys do apparently you hit bags of balls on the range after you lost yesterday what were you trying to accomplish,yeah i think as everyone knows who's played this game it's a very difficult game at times and i feel like it's testing me a little more than it has done in the last few years i feel the only way to get through it is to put your head down and work on the right things and sort of trust the process of maybe put in the hard work and my dad always said you get out of it what you put into it and that's the attitude that i'm sort of bringing with me to the course each and every day there's going to be some good days there's going to be some bad but i feel like i'm on the right path,0
rory mcilroy,0,2021-03,2021,151,1,0,1,not to play amateur psychologist but you're obviously one of the longest players on the pga tour why do you think you went down that route,i think a lot of people did i'd be lying if i said it wasn't anything to do with what bryson did at the u s open i think a lot of people saw that and were like whoa if this is the way they're going to set golf courses up in the future it helps it really helps the one thing that people don't appreciate is how good bryson is out of the rough not only because of how upright he is but because his short irons are longer than standard so he can get a little more speed through the rough than us than other guys and i thought being able to get some more speed is a good thing and i maybe just to the detriment a little bit of my swing i got there but i just need to maybe rein it back in a little bit,0
rory mcilroy,0,2021-03,2021,148,0,1,1,you sounded a little dejected on sunday night at bay hill was that just a spur of the moment knee jerk thing or are you feeling you do need a spark to get you going this season,yeah look there's been again it's hard to sit here and complain because we have it way better than a lot of other people in the world i think it's all relative there's been challenges there's been maybe having to get to tournaments a day earlier to get tested obviously all the covid protocols maybe the challenge for some people not having fans out there and the atmosphere of tournaments being not as good as it usually is but in the grand scheme of things they're not challenges it hasn't it would be very i think it would be wrong of me to sit here and say that life has been hard for the past year because i recognize and i think everyone else out here on tour recognizes that we've been very lucky compared to the vast majority of people that have had to live through this,0
rory mcilroy,0,2021-03,2021,82,1,0,1,you mentioned this does kind of feel like the one year anniversary at least in the golf world of the pandemic hitting with that in mind and also with the caveat that obviously there are people out there who are struggling way way more than pga tour players how has this last year been extra challenging compared to years in the past as far as life on tour,no it hasn't changed at all i haven't heard much about them over the past year if they've been making the rounds they certainly haven't been approaching us or my team again i think with the new strategic partnership between the pga tour and the european tour i think that is the beginning of something that could become quite significant yeah it's not something that i've heard a lot of and yeah i just can't see where they can go from here,0
rory mcilroy,0,2021-03,2021,309,0,1,1,how would you compare your level of confidence right now versus how you felt when you're on a heater coming into this tournament last year,yeah it's a weird one right because like for example like most of you guys in the media can still maybe not do your job percent from home but there's a majority of it that you can still do from maybe not being at a tournament site maybe not seeing and interacting with the players and seeing the shots but there's enough coverage on tv that you can certainly write about it it's funny because like a year into it you think okay we hopefully will be done now the vaccine is rolling out and there's light at the end of the tunnel so even somewhere last week in orlando sort of following the news of say a texas opening back up again and removing the mask mandate and all that stuff there's a part of me that likes that right there's a part of me that likes people to have freedom and to have their own choice and all of that but then you walk into like a busy restaurant in florida and you're sort of taken aback and you're like whoa maybe we're just not quite ready for this yet the idea is great and the idea you're comfortable with but then when you actually start to live it it's like whoa maybe this is a little too soon yeah i know what you mean you are certainly going to have that coming back but hopefully by the end of the summer getting into the fall things start to become a little more normal again i don't think there's going to be any permanent changes i still think there's going to be fans on site there's going to be media members on site i certainly think that everyone is looking forward to the day when things can go back to where they were pre the players championship,0
rory mcilroy,0,2021-03,2021,134,0,1,1,we're obviously a year coming back to the players with the quarantine and everything just the thoughts on this last year what it's been like coming back to play with the shut to down then coming back to play just your overall thoughts on everything,yeah i mean i'm really happy that we played this week in this sort of atmosphere and this environment i've missed this a lot even though it's only whatever percent capacity this week it feels so much more than that and it's great to play in front of that i'm looking forward to doing it again next week i think that it is i think we're all sort of now seeing a light at the end of the tunnel where things can at least get back to some sort of normality pretty soon but yeah i mean i can't believe it's been a year it's going to be surreal looking back in years time and sort of seeing what we lived through but yeah i'm just looking forward to things going back to normal,0
rory mcilroy,0,2021-03,2021,147,1,1,1,you touched on it a little but this place makes a lot of people uncomfortable with the wind and the rough up you seem to have such a great comfort level here is that just from the start or something,yeah i've always felt comfortable here i think that i saw a stat the other day that this course more than any other one the pga tour the correlation between strokes gained off the tee and performance at this course is higher than anywhere else and obviously myself and bryson no and in strokes gained off the tee for the seasons and we both shot two good scores today i think it is it's one of these places where there's a lot of holes where everyone just hits it in the same spots off the tee but then when you can give yourself an advantage by taking driver and getting it up there tee shots like tee shots like where some of the shorter guys are having to go up the sliver of fairway up the right when longer guys don't have to really worry about that,0
rory mcilroy,0,2021-03,2021,122,1,0,1,secondly your career is notorious for having these little mini slumps out of nowhere even when you were winning majors frankly i don't get a sense that the struggle you had recently was like those,no i don't think it's been like that for awhile no it hasn't been like that for awhile where i've had these huge highs and huge lows i sort of i feel like i've become a little more consistent in my game over the last few years but like even somewhere like at which is nine years ago believe it or not in that run in the summer where i won the pga and the playoff events and stuff i missed five cuts in the space of like nine events so it was a little more feast and famine back then i think it it's a little more consistent as i'm getting a little older and having a few more gray hairs,0
rory mcilroy,0,2021-03,2021,68,1,0,1,you're one of five consecutive international winners at this event anything that you can point to for the reason for that success by you guys,i don't think so i don't think there's any i don't think this course suits internationals more than anyone else i honestly just think that more internationals play in this event than most other pga tour events and these things go in cycles and i wouldn't look too much into it but yeah it is interesting that a lot of internationals have won here the last few years,0
rory mcilroy,0,2021-01,2021,120,1,0,1,and in the days when you needed a boarding pass you famously wrote your goals down on it have you noted down goals for,phil won an the pga tour as well at years old yeah it's funny when i came you know i came here to abu dhabi as an year old yeah i would have been an year old first time i played here was my first year on the european tour and i honestly really couldn't see myself at that point playing past and then i'm now and i'm like geez that doesn't seem like that far away yeah look i still feel like i have a good years left in me if i'm competitive and can still play i can see myself doing what the likes of lee and tiger and phil have done over the past couple of years,0
rory mcilroy,0,2021-01,2021,120,0,1,1,obviously you were talking about tiger and longevity of players you as a year old seeing what lee westwood managed last season do you feel that you could still go for another good decade and a half and still be right at the top of your game as lee has done and obviously has tiger has been getting back at the masters,yeah seen a lot of them i didn't really go anywhere like once the masters was over we just went back to florida my mum and dad stayed there there was no point in them going back home with everything that was going on with lockdowns back in northern ireland so yeah we saw a lot of each other my in laws came down for thanksgiving and christmas yeah we had a nice time so yeah a lot of family time which i feel very fortunate about that because of where we live and it is maybe a lot more open than other places around the world we had the opportunity to spend time with family which was really nice,0
rory mcilroy,0,2021-01,2021,237,1,0,1,also as we know the news about the european tour hooking up with the pga tour just wondering what can you see in the future could that lead to in the bigger picture,i mean i think he's already responded really really well i think he realised he made a big mistake as soon as it was brought to him last week in hawai'i and he completely owned up to it he said he messed up he's going to try to be better and you know justin is true to his word he will be yeah i've gotten to know justin really well and he is as good a guy as they come he's got a lot of integrity a lot of character obviously it doesn't make what he said any better but you know i think in this day and age it's hard because it seems like you can't you're not allowed to make a mistake anymore any mistake gets jumped on look he made a mistake he owned up to it and he'll be better because of it he'll maybe not be as maybe ignorant to things that are sort of i'm trying to think of the right word here offend people i guess obviously what he said was offensive to a large portion of the population but again he'll be better for it he'll learn and he'll move on and look he'll be just as good a golfer as he's always been and if anything it will probably just make him a better person than he already is which is hard because he's already a great guy,0
rory mcilroy,0,2020-11,2020,191,1,0,1,MODERATOR,i think everything was up in the air at one point i think when the open championship was canceled i had serious doubts that you know we'd play a masters this year in i think the r a were in a tough situation the fact that if they pushed it back the daylight in the u k just isn't there to hold a field of i think one of the nice things about the masters is it's limited fields and you can put people off two tees and pretty much guarantee that most of us are going to get finished if there isn't any weather delays you know augusta maybe had some things in its favor that the open championship didn't but yeah i think everyoneâ€‘â€‘ it's been a collective effort i think the pga tour has worked with augusta national with r a with the usga and pga of america if anything it's made the game at least at the top level a little more cohesive i think the different organizations are working together and working better together and that's a good thing for the game going forward as well,0
jordan spieth,0,2024-02,2024,133,1,0,1,it's not the first time won't be the last time the pga tour is in a situation like where we're at you finished early on thursday and then got back out there today what goes through your mind and how do you prepare for situations like that,i kind of took yesterday as a practice day the conditions were really nice i wished we were playing it was obviously not the better end of the draw but i've had plenty of both sides i tried to come out here and get like what would be a normal good practice session day knowing i was only going to play a couple holes i hit a workout and i did about two and a half hours of practice just working on some things right now so it was actually kind of nice to have a little time to do it in the middle of the tournament and took a few holes today to actually feel like i got it going but hopefully i can continue to improve as the weekend goes on,0
justin thomas,0,2023-10,2023,129,1,0,1,MODERATOR,i personally didn't think so i thought it was really great of zach and the pga to be accommodating to have us come over here and take a little scouting trip and i think that was obviously didn't show but felt it was very helpful it's a very very busy long week with very different routines and schedules that you would have in a normal week and this week the loss that we had this week has absolutely nothing to do with team camaraderie because this is probably the closest team i've ever been a part of we unfortunately just didn't play well enough kind of like max said earlier about sam i can't speak on behalf of everybody but i didn't feel the preparation was necessarily the issue,0
justin thomas,0,2023-10,2023,6,0,1,1,you said a little bit ago that this was the closest team you've ever been on curious now that this event is over is there some sort of example or moment this week that you guys pondered the most whether it was a laugh or a joke,living it up with the baby,0
jordan spieth,0,2023-09,2023,247,0,1,1,you've been a part of some of these teams over the past decade how have you seen the concept of pods evolve from when you first started to kind of what it is now in,i think you know the answer to the second one i don't think there's any of that as i kind of alluded to before not only were most of the guys not even born the ones that were weren't even alive then and i think to your point saying that means it was a long long time ago rickie has played in three over here i've played in two over here brooks and justin played in one over here we weren't on all those losing teams i was on a couple of them but i played well justin played well brooks has played well so it's not it doesn't matter to us i guess is the feeling i don't mean to speak for everybody but i would be somebody who could probably speak on that matter on our team i said it at whistling straits after the round i said that this is really nice but until we win one over there nobody can talk about a change in the ryder cup or the u s or anything like that having said that i don't think the europeans are underestimating us by any means i think it's going to be a really really good match this year i think they have guys that are playing fantastic golf especially of late and really good form with an unbelievable crowd behind them and we've got a really tall task but we have a phenomenal group of guys as well,0
jordan spieth,0,2023-08,2023,78,0,1,1,how many bottles of water gatorade,i drank a ton of my livpur hydration packets i think you can't overdo it yeah i was trying to force it down i tried to force down food too just got to do anything to continue to have energy it was hot but it's hot a lot i'm not going to sit there and say we haven't had this kind of heat before but coming from the scottish and british it was certainly a little bit different,0
jordan spieth,0,2023-07,2023,98,1,0,1,would you like to play over here more if possible,i play the two events we have on the pga over here and then last year played some links in ireland i like the idea of coming over a few days early playing some new places where i haven't played before and then going scottish to british or scottish to the open i know i'm supposed to say the open yeah i really enjoy it it's really far from home so no i don't wish that i played like half the season over here or anything but i really enjoy the middle of the summer coming over here,0
jordan spieth,0,2023-07,2023,234,0,1,1,obviously a lot going on with liv and the senate hearings which you unfortunately missed yesterday playing north berwick apparently what are your thoughts on where the tour is with this framework and what part of it concerns you if any,i guess i'm not exactly sure because it seems like you see reports you hear things and then you see reports and then some things have changed and then other things have changed then there's disagreements on a couple items i think if there's any disagreements it won't work honestly we're very much in the dark on it i don't sit on the board and i'm not on the pac either i'm on the in you talk to a lot of other players it's been quite a shock from the get go i wouldn't say that there's enough details to be able to really comment much on any concerns because like if i if you ask me about something specifically i could say i saw that somewhere and i saw that somewhere else that it wasn't part of it so i really don't know i'm sure i guess jay is returning monday and i'm sure as he starts to speak with you guys maybe things have gone further clearly i think we would probably liked to have seen him at the senate hearing if he was able to do so just as a representative of the tour but i don't know if there's anything that concerns me i just hear if you name one factor of it i've probably heard yes and no on either side of it on about every piece of it,0
jordan spieth,0,2023-07,2023,68,1,0,1,pga tour players like to know everything in great detail is it weird not knowing much at all,i don't necessarily think that's accurate i think in your profession if somebody was making decisions that was affecting you that you had no control over and i'm sure that happens in places but you're not in a member owned organisation nonprofit organisation i think that anybody in that situation would like to have maybe a little bit more communication prior to massive changes and decisions being done,0
jordan spieth,0,2023-07,2023,132,1,0,1,i take it based being on the board you knew randall stephenson what did you make of his resignation,yeah very close with randall for almost ten years now i think that it's a bummer because i think it was or years he served on the board of the pga tour and it's a voluntary board looking out for the players best interests and the future of pga tour golf i think he did as much as anybody to help put that in the right place i think it's a huge asset that we lost at the same time as he retired from at t i know he's been looking to spend real retirement life and maybe do a little bit less and do other things but i think his letter says how he feels and makes a lot of sense to me on where he's at regarding the entire situation,0
jordan spieth,0,2023-07,2023,126,1,1,1,a couple of things were said yesterday that were quite jaw dropping the sheer numbers and the amount of money that's available in comparison with the pga tour billion as opposed to the assets of the pga tour billion i think it was jimmy dunne that said that there's a real fear if they don't do something about liv they are going to overtake how does it make you feel that the tour that you played on is at threat,it's not a great feeling i don't necessarily believe that just the differences in finances would create a threat to go through to not look to just having options or at least communicating on why things would get done when they get done i think as i mentioned to you i mean you know it's a member run organisation with a voluntary board that's supposed to look out for the interests of the pga tour players on the board i don't believe that these decisions had to be made without involving call it players on the board and other board members but that's my opinion on the matter and maybe there's a reason again i just don't know otherwise i could probably answer your question better,0
jordan spieth,0,2023-06,2023,76,1,0,1,what's the stress level on a course like this which is a little tougher when you find yourself in the junk and different places i know you're a genius at it but is it a higher stress level at a course like this,it just depends you just have to recognize if it's worth it or not the percentages become quite a bit different when to go for it and when to take your medicine but we played what the pga colonial was playing like this the u s open coming up so it's almost like the norm now it's not like we're going from an extremely scorable place right into this so i think that's helped a bit,0
jordan spieth,0,2023-06,2023,215,1,0,1,jordan a today the conditions the way they were with the course the way it was how good did that feel,it felt like a great round it was nice to beat a tough golf course i did that on sunday at the pga and then a place that historically has been i think the best place for me as a professional at colonial to miss the cut there was just was such a bummer so to come out and put good work in feel really healthy and get a lot of short game work in and get my touch feel like my touch is back it started on the first hole today i mean i feel like the bunker play is one of the strengths of my game and the last couple tournaments it's been really poor actually poor enough to not allow me to have a chance to win golf tournaments i hit a pretty fantastic shot there and it just gave me a lot of confidence like all right my entry point's back i feel good about sliding the club under the ball and stuff like that and scrambled really well i didn't strike it particularly well at all but i don't feel like that's far off i feel like it was actually like kind of an off day in that and i got away with a lot by the way i scrambled,0
jordan spieth,0,2023-06,2023,152,0,1,1,leading a tournament any tournament major or not is kind of unusual did that get your attention when you go out here and it did live up to your expectations,this is one of those tournaments you look at the app and you see where everyone's hitting shots and what they're making and where they're leaving it to certain pins like you pay more attention to it because you just have to think your way through this course so much and especially when it gets like this so u s opens are led with under to start the round so they have the ability to do i think whatever they want with the greens and really the golf course here so i don't expect it to get absurd like it could other places but i don't think it's going to be any easier so i would imagine single digits and maybe even low single digits so having said that i don't think you approach it any differently that's how i thought about today's round was just trying to shoot something under par,0
jordan spieth,0,2023-06,2023,155,1,0,1,if last week was the worst of your bunker play what did you find in the three days since then that you were able to do what you did today,i just got thrown off at the pga i had a lot of really weird difficult bunker shots there i think i just lost a little of my entry point i had a lot of like plugged lies i had some like yard ones from up slopes and then colonial is normally the best ones and i just i think i sent one too far once and then i just bailed on a bunch so i just needed to get in just get in and work on it it's the one part of the game i've worked the least on since i injured my wrist because it's the one thing that hurts the most is flicking a bunker shot over like that so we held off on that for a couple weeks and then i put a lot of work in this week with it and it felt fine and it certainly yielded results today,0
jordan spieth,0,2023-05,2023,222,1,0,1,MODERATOR,that's one of the beauties of the pga championship you don't really see it to that extent but every or years but how cool he's extremely accomplished in his own right i know we have some mutual friends i met him yesterday on the th tee he was turning and i played the back nine behind him we were actually watching it while flying home and when that happened it had frozen before they'd hit and my phone was blowing up with my friends like you've got to be kidding me no way no way i'm like what happened they're like he just dunked it on just insane absolutely insane i think what was so cool about that as a player that can get caught into a decade out here and think of it as work more than play is you saw how he embraced that entire week and he's talked about it after as like you'll look back and think of a couple of weeks in your life and this may be one of the best ones i've had it's like man we get to do that every week i think if you can kind of help keep that perspective and be a little more like michael block week to week it would be a good thing for all of us,0
jordan spieth,0,2023-05,2023,369,1,0,1,jordan what are some of the challenges playing the week right after a major or maybe some of the benefits of doing that,well i think one of the challenges is just kind of getting back up if we had to start today i think it would be a little harder you just wouldn't feel like but one of the things i've recognized playing the week after the majors if you take it a little casually that monday tuesday and you only give yourself wednesday i don't feel like i'm ready to go in an event that if i'm going to play a pga tour event i want to be as sharp as possible because there's guys that were here on sunday and monday preparing and you've got to think about that i came over i was not planning on coming over yesterday i worked with my coach until about i was like well i think i'm going to go over there and play nine and get on the course i'm glad i did because they changed to overseed around the greens it's an adjustment from even though i've played this tournament ten times and played the course a number of times even when the tournament's not being played that changes things on where you want to layup where you want to go for it so i'm glad i came over i think the biggest challenge is getting yourself to you just put so much effort to try and peak for four weeks you don't want the letdown of taking it too easy the next week but the biggest benefit is i feel typically after a major you feel as sharp as you can feel this case specifically going in and feeling like i got better each round last week makes me pretty confident about continuing that trend this week i would have loved for the pga to be this week and colonial the next week just so i had that extra time to feel this way about last week but it's in the past coming to a place where i can hopefully press on the gas pedal and kind of get back to where i felt like i was three or four weeks ago which was on a really really nice trend upwards as we head into a couple more majors,0
jordan spieth,0,2023-05,2023,110,0,1,1,welcome back to texas hope you thawed out by now other than the four weeks that y'all are all together do you pay any attention to what's going on on the liv golf tour,yeah here and there i asked d j on sunday when they're playing next so i guess not that close of attention because i think they play this week i'm aware of who wins the tournament but i don't know the team stuff i don't necessarily know who's on whose team other than a couple different guys i guess yes and no like i've got a decent idea of who wins the tournament because it's around but i don't know a whole lot other than that like where they're playing when their schedule is who's on whose team i know how their format works and stuff but that's about it,0
jordan spieth,0,2023-05,2023,92,1,0,1,other than being back in texas and getting to sleep in your own bed or see your people do you have a favorite tour stop somewhere,this is one of my favorites for the reasons i mentioned at the very beginning where it feels like a home game without anything added next week's a pretty phenomenal one riviera is my favorite golf course consistently on the pga tour next week is about as good as it gets from a player experience yeah this part of the year is really really enjoyable you get a couple home games and muirfield's pretty awesome pga mixed in there this is a really fun stretch to try to have your game on,0
jordan spieth,0,2023-04,2023,66,0,1,1,obviously phil and some others are in this event forever until they want to stop playing to see what he did what koepka did what some of the other liv guys did do the majors lose something down the stretch if those guys aren't able to get in somehow,i don't i mean if you qualify you qualify i've always been a proponent that you shouldn't keep somebody out if they qualified as long as people keep qualifying whoever you typically have the fields that you normally have because that criteria makes you have to play really really good golf so i don't see a scenario where it's not going to happen to be honest,0
jordan spieth,0,2023-04,2023,161,1,0,1,is this something you realized this week playing too much golf,yeah i started to kind of realize it i would say this week a little bit in match play it was more than i've ever really played in that stretch no regrets i didn't know but i would attest some of my decision making just to a level of focus that i wish i had a little bit more of if i'm trying to pinpoint it it seems like i don't remember the last time i tried to peak on my eighth out of ten weeks in a row i don't remember ever having that so yeah like i said this is a year that's a bridge year for us on the pga tour so i want to keep playing the elevated events as well as the other events that i really love to play so i knew that was going to happen this year but it should be decided for me in the future which would be a good thing,0
jordan spieth,0,2023-04,2023,173,0,1,1,is chasing somebody who's won a major championship different than chasing someone who has not won one,regardless there's nothing you can control what you can control ideally it would be somebody who would care more and potentially be feeling different than maybe brooks will be but at the same time it's been a little while for him too he did win last week i don't know kind of the way that feels on the liv tour but he did win there against really good players and comes in playing in great control of his game and has dealt with pushing a lead already out here yeah ideally it would be if you were chasing you don't want to be chasing tiger woods you want to be chasing somebody who's never been there but it doesn't matter because you control what you can control you and the golf course i won't do much scoreboard watching if he pushes it forward then i needed to play better the first two days but i'll have a goal given the conditions and it'll try to be to shoot under par on the weekend,0
jordan spieth,0,2023-03,2023,125,0,1,1,you must be pretty happy with that start how would you assess that under round,yeah i would have said i would have signed for or as you kind of do around this place yeah it was cold and then it got a little breezy so it wasn't playing easy at all with only hitting like five ish fairways you do that around this place and shoot under par it's pretty solid i was able to sneak a couple extras with the putter today i've been feeling like my putting's been working towards where i really want it to be i felt like i made a few really nice par saves from that to foot range that kept that round alive bogey free around this track is not something you're going to do every day so very pleased with it,0
jordan spieth,0,2023-03,2023,211,0,1,1,you obviously want to hit more fairways but on a day you don't and still produce a really good score what's the inner satisfaction of that,i mean very satisfying on a course like this yeah and i had four or five that were within a yard off or something like that but that's a big difference out here you can't really spin it into these greens with feeling comfortable with the speed control and just overall with the putter it allowed even if i was missing them i felt like i could play to center of greens and not attack pins that's a different place than i've been living as i've been trying to get better and better with the putter so holes like number today i didn't go at the pin at all i just went to the center of the green and said i'll putt from feet and move on and try and get a look on the last two so that part's freed up the fact that i didn't hit a lot of fairways and then if i start to my ball striking been really solid including off the tee in the last month or so and it just needs to tighten up a little bit i didn't feel like i did great work the last three days and it kind of felt that way today so hopefully just gets better each day,0
jordan spieth,0,2023-03,2023,269,0,1,1,MODERATOR,yeah it was everything at the time i didn't have any status anywhere and i had made a decision not to go secure korn ferry tour status the week prior and go to puerto rico instead and played well and then got into here i wasn't expecting to play this tournament at all and i got up and down out of the front bunker on made probably like a or footer that i didn't know if it was going to get me to the dollar amount or not but i knew it was important i think it was t or something i mean that was huge that opened up all the opportunities for the rest of the year that kind of was a springboard for getting all the way to the tour championship and then the presidents cup and just really really great memories that i wouldn't have had if it were weren't for the finish to this event i holed a shot on like a flop shot and then got up and down on and i played the back nine today between the memories and then closing it out on number it was just kind of fun to relive those shots it always has been coming back here it had been a little while now so tried to have some fun with it it's a special tournament that i don't forget about that the way things go over years there's some tournaments when they change in the schedule you just can't make it and this is one i'm glad and hopefully i can continue to come back to,0
jordan spieth,0,2023-03,2023,424,1,0,1,on sunday you got asked a question about the run scheffler's been on and you gave a pretty insightful answer in depth answer as to the feelings that you have when you're on that sort of run and yet at the same time you sounded maybe a little bit wistful like wishing i was back sort of in that zone i don't even know if that's the right word but i wonder if you could describe maybe what that's like to know what he's doing have done it yourself maybe trying to get back to doing that again,it's always a fine line it's always a fine line it's a fine line between pga tour professionals and korn ferry tour or top college and then fine line between top amateur play it's little things it's always just in the margins but also like scottie's got an it factor he's got an ability to get out of trouble when he's in it he's got incredible athleticism he's always had that but now he's kind of got that kind of confidence like hey i'm just going to play the patient game today someone else is going to make a mistake i'm going to play the course the way it's supposed to be played and when you start winning and you kind of get that feeling of house money it's a little bit easier to just be okay with that that kind of freedom that comes with that you would imagine like maybe someone like myself should just feel that way but if you're not doing it consistently you lose a little bit of that and you got to kind of just force your way up there in order to feel it again like i went through a few year off spurt of winning after winning a few events a year and that first one back took i mean i was in position a few times that year and didn't pull it off where i may have if i was still in the same mental place as i was a few years before but you kind of almost got to build it back up to remember how to kind of close it out again sometimes every once in a while it just goes your way i would say hilton head just kind of went my way but sometimes you do everything right and it doesn't too so it's a crazy game but he's playing the patience game well at the top now and you got a couple guys that have all traded off that no position and there's a little bit of a gap below that and that's where i'm trying to work hard to get into where i feel like week in and week out i can be in the same position those guys are in scottie's got a chance to win most every week and you get more and more comfortable the more often you're there that level of comfort is something that's intangible and it's what propels you to continue to win multiple events a year and he's at that right now,0
jordan spieth,0,2023-03,2023,256,1,0,1,MODERATOR,i think the idea that i can confidently say that it's not two separate tours as much as that might be perceived that way in delaware that was the first presentation was essentially two separate tours to get to a place where every single full card holder can play in every single pga tour event that season meant there had to be some give from then i think it was the right thing to do you still have elevated events with the overall from delaware until now the idea being getting the top ranked players in the world playing as often together on the pga tour as possible i think that that's been done while providing an opportunity for any guys who are future stars to be able to still get into those top events within a week as well as any other card holder that may not start in the elevated events to starts the season so i think i'm pleased with the work the pga tour has done in regards to feedback from players i've felt like in the last six months maybe four months the communication has been fantastic and hopefully this is a product that doesn't need to be changed much once the nicks are kind of figured out over the next six months or so the little details hopefully it can be a situation where there doesn't have to be a lot of change over the next plus years and that was really the outlook that we all had on it,0
jordan spieth,0,2023-03,2023,170,0,1,1,on the schedule do you guys all feel liv a bit of thanks for all this have they triggered kind of everything that's changed here,yeah i would be lying if i said that we would have gone through this without liv but at the same time they haven't we haven't mentioned them in any of our discussions on what we think's best for the tour so there was a few things obviously like the player impact program stuff that the tour was doing to try and make sure they were could hold their best assets or best players whatever you want to call it and then from there it was all right everyone in this room's committed let's figure out what this future product model should look like then the tour's been all ears it's been a player friendly player organized situation so it's been honestly pretty fun to be a part of i hope that we can kick it off the right way and don't have to make too many adjustments to it because that's the main thing now is trying to get it as close to right the first time as possible,0
jordan spieth,0,2023-03,2023,139,0,1,1,max made the point yesterday that it might be tougher to have years of history and trying to retool or reshape something compared to like liv starting out from scratch and maybe not having any history behind it when you guys got into your meetings was that at all a struggle to ignore or what's been going on since,i think some of the veterans in there guys like tiger who are and even rory pretty influential and saying hey this is a meritocracy and we need to keep it the way that like a lot of things in line with the way the tour you know essentially take some out of pip boost it back into purses stuff where when you play well you get rewarded and you don't if you don't keeping it that way to an extent keeping that in mind i should say and i think we've found a pretty good balance right now in holding on to what you're talking about that history of it but also making modern adjustments that i think in my opinion reward appropriately to the guys who beat the best in the world week in and week out,0
jordan spieth,0,2023-03,2023,155,1,0,1,apparently it wasn't you then right,i don't know who came up with churn yeah but i mean obviously the other thing too is like the fedexcup that wasn't right the first time it wasn't right after years it wasn't you know so there were changes there that six seven years in you didn't really notice what people were upset about when it started i think you're looking at doing the same thing here but trying to look years in advance make sure that we're getting closer to what everyone is going to be happy with there honestly it's just about a commitment from the top guys the whole point is trying to get the best players in the world playing as often as possible on the pga tour in the same events and i think this scenario is a really good one and i think pretty close to the final of it with just a few kinks to get out,0
jordan spieth,0,2023-02,2023,177,1,0,1,kind of a wider scope question you turn obviously later this year especially in a field like this where there are a lot of young unknown players do you feel different do you feel like you're kind of moving into a different phase of your career as you hit a landmark like that,i really don't i still feel like one of the younger ones out here i don't know what the average age on the pga tour is now but i'm probably right smack dab in the middle of it but i don't feel like i'm in a next stage at all maybe when i turn that's the case i don't feel a whole lot different from call it five six seven years ago the first few years feel different because you're just starting out and something new happens each week but since then i feel the same that i have before i feel as healthy as i've felt in four five years i got sick pretty much every year from the end of until this last year over the winter break into the spring i've been on top of it this year and been as healthy so i feel maybe younger than certain years which is really nice especially like i said as i head into a pretty heavy stretch coming up through the masters through hilton head,0
jordan spieth,0,2023-02,2023,119,1,0,1,given the heritage and frankly the sponsorship of this tournament are you surprised that it didn't get the elevated status and do you see that changing,no i'm not this year surprised and i do think there is i would fight for an opportunity for this to be an elevated event in future years i'm not sure if the format would have to change or what would have to happen but not just because you know i play this event but i really think the opportunity to get the top players in the world playing pebble beach and that being a pga tour event would be as successful as when the u s open's held here i think that trying to go to the world's best courses when you have the opportunity would be advantageous for the pga tour so i will fight for it,0
jordan spieth,0,2023-02,2023,345,1,0,1,kind of following up his question about this tournament how important is it that the tour whether it's elevate or in some way support this tournament i mean it's obviously very distinctive and has sort of spread the interest in golf beyond the normal audience is it vital in your mind that this tournament gets that kind of support and find a way to thrive going forward because obviously it's a difficult run right now to get the pro field the way they want it,sure i think that it's very important i don't know if i would call it vital i think that it's very important i think that at t's commitment into professional golf with their commitment into the masters and then consistently in multiple events over the pga tour you want them to stay very involved in the pga tour that's really really good for us so figuring out a way to do so at what they would probably consider their flagship event other than obviously the masters i think is very important as a title sponsor of what is it to years something like that of this event that's a long term sponsorship of one of the oldest events on the pga tour at one of the most iconic venues in the world having said all that i think it is very important back to his point i don't know exactly how it could work because i don't even know how it's all going to work in any elevated event going forward and that's trying to be figured out soon so i think once that happens then you can this is the unique one where it's a pro am right so that a lot of most of the tournaments are going to want to be an elevated event i would imagine even if that requires a little more of a commitment and i don't think at t would shy down from that but i think that it's going to be it's a little trickier than your typical elevated event given the format but i think something can be done i think it's extremely important that it does get done here i just can you imagine you know at this point who are the hottest players in the world rory and rahm the hottest two players in the world right now coming down at pebble beach a bunch of others in the top in the world gunning them down it's hypothetically you know it would be must watch television i would love to see it happen somehow,0
jordan spieth,0,2023-02,2023,234,0,1,1,liv's had a small effect on this event in particular but it got me to wondering that the one thing i've heard over the last probably six or seven months of the players who have gone over the one guy that players seem to miss the most is d j who used to be a regular of yours here why is that why do people miss d j,well i think he had what does he have or wins yeah he's one of the he's a hall of fame player somebody who guys people and the celebrities here really enjoyed being around he was he's a freak athlete that plays golf he really loved this event loved playing with wayne we had a blast i know that because we had a blast with him for what eight years i think we played with them eight or nine we played together if you're talking about in general and not just this event you know i think there's a number of guys that are missed but i think d j being maybe the first one to go over there and somebody who is not never was really controversial over here and more so just kind of worked his butt off it paid off got his breakthrough at the u s open then went and won the masters just a hall of fame player that didn't create controversy with any other players and played on a bunch of presidents cup and ryder cup teams represented 'em really well he was a friend of mine he is a friend of mine i just haven't seen him but i always really enjoyed playing with him and being around him he plays fast easy to play with fun to watch smooth i don't know what else to say,0
jordan spieth,0,2023-02,2023,247,1,0,1,MODERATOR,well i'm an f fan because of drive to survive and i'm one of however many million americans that it reached and went outside of your typical f fan base which was already massive and global but for golf to see the drive to survive success and then the opportunity that we can be a part of trying to get out of the typical golf fan base kind of look they did but get global with it and as you mentioned million members is larger than your typical who tunes in to see a round of pga tour golf so what an opportunity to kind of have some fun with it too i mean i had a blast i gave access in places i don't normally and shared a lot of it with justin and so we really really enjoyed that process of kind of giving a glimpse into what our day to day is given how close we are and then the names that showed up in order to do it especially this last year with how wild professional golf was i mean what a year to start filming so you get that kind of access too so just it should have a pretty profound impact on growing the game of golf and hopefully brings more fans to the pga tour specifically but it was really cool to see the majors step in as well and offer that kind of access that they don't normally give,0
jordan spieth,0,2023-02,2023,85,1,0,1,MODERATOR,yeah i played in the u s amateur there but it was no years prior so yeah so they went up with us flew up with us to play the practice round flew back down filmed some content from just a fun gambling practice round day and mile an hour winds and then how that i mean it just worked out perfectly kind of led to justin winning the pga there so you kind of see that whole story line take place within our episode,0
jordan spieth,0,2023-01,2023,142,0,1,1,what was that like,i was by myself there so i had tons of room and we didn't load it up yet we had just got it in yeah it'll be fun there's a number at one point i think there was a dozen guys four of them went to liv and sold theirs because they don't really have the whole swings it's hard to go saudi to chicago in a two week stretch in an rv i think that had a lot to do with it but i don't know i mean i was next to jay day obviously bubba was a guy who had them for a long time jason day got a new one in annie is trying to recruit a lot of our friends out here to do it so we'll see in the next few years if that works or not,0
jordan spieth,0,2023-01,2023,77,1,0,1,was there someone that gave you inspiration to join that group,we tried one and harding park pga so we tested it out there annie wanted one for a while i didn't really want one prior to sammy like knowing he would sleep through the night and schedule and all that because close quarters compared to renting a house so she's wanted one for a while and it was just a matter of if the perfect one came at the right time and it did this last fall,0
jordan spieth,0,2023-01,2023,311,1,0,1,as far as your golf what's your level can you describe what expectations are like when you come to a tournament you ever surprised by the way you play,so i would say like i started really well in ' maybe a couple events in ' where a day like today where i shot or under to start i think i remember doing it at travelers one time and the pga in ' i just remember thinking i know where my game is at and i can maybe fake it as best i can but it's not i don't really have great control i used my hands really well for a couple days conveniently the first two in a row so it's not like you it's not like i didn't believe it's just i have a good idea of where things are at and if i have that shot or don't have that shot this is different the last couple years have been a little different where off to a good start and i'm like okay i think i can improve a little to gain just a little bit more control but i was in really good control and for me it's about freedom it's not separating arms from the body and having to save shots it's feeling like i'm in front of them and being able to hold them off and nice fluid strokes on the greens that's really all it comes down to seems simple but when you're still fighting the urge to want to hit it hard or get over some bad habits days like today i'm not surprised but what i will say is i'm confident relative to other time periods i've been off to similar starts which is a really good place to be i believe i can shoot or under each day out here not to say that that means it'll happen but there are other times i would be sitting there going how do i hold this shit together to be honest seriously,0
jordan spieth,0,2023-01,2023,260,0,1,1,and secondly however ' looks like in terms of size of field whatever gets determined how important do you thinking it is to have a cut,okay the vast thousands of kids that have justin thomas as their favorite player not that he misses a lot of cuts but one week say you are to even cut it on a saturday and cut ten or fifteen guys out to be able to go twos or whatever random times before daylight savings guaranteeing that they have baseball games or tournaments on saturday the only day they can go sunday guaranteeing that you're going to be able to see your favorite player play regardless if they have a chance to win that day or not see that's the part where i'm like it would be kind of nice to be able to have that opportunity for fans but at the same time i think that the golf that we've the professional golf that we've been playing for all this time of the tournaments that i've played in maybe more have had cuts and you have to play well and that's part of when you're off the fight to not mail it in and try to work your way into making that cut so i'm either way i'm indifferent on it but i've been stronger on one side or the other at different time periods but when it comes to the argument of cut for world ranking points or whatever and obviously the conversation with liv i just i don't think that we should be doing something we should be doing what's best for our or tour and forget about the consequences and any reaction that would cause elsewhere,0
jordan spieth,0,2023-01,2023,166,1,0,1,that one kid right,i think that well and i haven't been a board member for well over a year but to answer your question on the way it was when i was i would say that you have to be yeah you have to be you're representing the entire membership you're representing no and no on the fedex and the guy with medical status you have to throw out where your position is regardless of if you're playing poorly you want help positions you're in if you're playing poor you only want help top guys you have to look out for the membership and really the maybe the future of the pga tour and that doesn't mean helping certain guys or others but it might if the product is going to be better one way or the other so you have to be somewhat objective versus when i'm out playing myself being like man i wish this was this way that would help me so yeah a little bit,0
jordan spieth,0,2023-01,2023,266,1,0,1,million and how much his life could change,it's one of the really cool things about the pga tour that that's possible and it has happened shoot i played with the last guy to do it on saturday corey conners i think in san antonio played with him on saturday or sunday was he the last one to do it maybe in san antonio sound right yeah he won that week presidents cup player you know multiple tour winner now but yeah to be an elevated event with now the money that comes with that but back to that point i did have one more thing to say on the like what you're thinking about i don't think it necessarily matters your financial status i think what's more important than anything about the difference in money coming down the stretch and again i may not be the player to poll on this is the idea that it secures your job for multiple years versus not securing it for the next year there has been a number of guys who lose a playoff and finish second and they don't get their doesn't get their card back but the guy who won off beating him in a playoff one hole is guaranteed at least two years which gives you so much it's just a massive it's not just that two years like the freedom you must feel the difference i know that i'm out here for this much longer my contracts get more guaranteed now it's a much bigger deal than thinking about the difference in the money from that week think is the status difference,0
jordan spieth,0,2023-01,2023,1,1,0,1,secondly outside of the pga is there a regular pga tour event that you haven't won that gnaws at you that you would like to,riviera,0
jordan spieth,0,2023-01,2023,154,1,0,1,it did for one year,oh it did for one year the two guys in that playoff neither one had won so that was obviously different i don't know who was third i think justin was and he wasn't so happy about it but yeah i think overall if you can get if you can get as many of the top players in the world playing on the most beautiful and amazing golf courses to be able to showcase that and this being one of 'em especially given the time that it is and the weather you have in the majority of the united states being able to play in prime time as well i think it's a massive advantage for us on the pga tour if we can do that so if it becomes a world ranking criteria that would be great as well just to try and get as many of the top guys as you can,0
jordan spieth,0,2022-12,2022,59,1,0,1,MODERATOR,i would say anyone who i've talked to about it says you've got to play it there's not a ton of current pga tour players probably half the field maybe so it's not talked about i guess a ton but amongst those who have played it they obviously love coming here and they continue to come here every year,0
jordan spieth,0,2022-12,2022,69,1,0,1,MODERATOR,i see maybe once a year like i don't see bernhard but masters week and he was somebody that you say hi and haven't seen for a little while mark o'meara and it seems like maybe what would be a mix of a pga and a champions tour event seems pretty light and not super competitive but i'm sure that will change when we get saturday night into sunday,0
jordan spieth,0,2022-12,2022,151,1,0,1,you were telling us that he's got a motto to swing it light,it's funny both the and year old were in the locker room at the same time that was new for me there's a dispersion on the pga tour but it's like to not to so that was cool to see annika's son and then mr player were in there so i mean i'm fortunate been fortunate to be around everybody who is here so i wouldn't say but i actually am really excited for our first round pairing as i mentioned earlier just watching nelly's success and i grew up with jessica and just kind of to see that duo on the lpga taking over it will be fun to play fun in the same event and not super excited that she's on the same tees as dad kind of wish dad was up with her dad but maybe he'll take it as a challenge and he'll be up for it,0
jordan spieth,0,2022-09,2022,102,1,0,1,it was a wonderful moment before you teed off on the st tee you had your wife there you picked up sam and showed him off to the crowd what does it mean to you to have this individual pursuit be a team game,i've always looked at it as a team everyone's got their role on my team even playing pga tour events then you know when you get to do it collectively with representing your country with some of the best players in the world i think max said it really well you just can't put a price on it there's really nothing that's more enjoyable still got to get another what did as much as i could this week it was kind of weird not having my partner right next to me but i'm going to go try to support him right now,0
justin thomas,0,2022-09,2022,101,1,0,1,justin what kind of excitement is there to play alongside your great friend jordan spieth and combined you get another point at the presidents cup for your team,yeah it's the best i think we were all talking about it last night and i know i talked to max about it a while it's just obviously if you could choose you know you'd rather win a major you'd rather win a pga tour event those mean and maybe do more for your career but these are just it's just more fun it truly is more fun winning points for your team getting to celebrate and kind of embrace the crowd you can't beat it once again you guys were able to save the hole coming out of the creek,0
jordan spieth,0,2022-09,2022,43,0,1,1,so jordan the streak is alive i'm not talking about you guys winning matches i'm talking about jordan's creek as named by justin yesterday,yeah it was the first time the ball's actually gone in the water though so let's make that clear and we've parred the other two times it's a tough hole so really that was just the first time we played the hole poorly,0
justin thomas,0,2022-09,2022,215,0,1,1,MODERATOR,yeah they're all different and i think they're all close in different ways you know some of it where it's all the significant others are maybe closer there's ones where it's kind of like it's all very close but it's almost in like groups of four or whatever it is but it's just all of us guys i think get along so well and i think what's most important is we really just respect each other's games i think max said it yesterday he's not necessarily extremely close with anybody i mean i would say that i'm good friends a lot of us are good friends with him or each other but it's not like we're you know we live in different areas we don't hang out that often but we all respect each other's games i think that's when we get in a situation and an atmosphere like this we have belief in one another and it's just like i said yesterday it's fun to be able to root for each other in terms of tomorrow yeah all of us are just going to keep our heads down and i mean i think we're going to be playing a little pissed off and try to go win points and see what we can do,0
justin thomas,0,2022-09,2022,168,0,1,1,billy congrats on the win just curious you wanted to be on one of these teams for a long time today was your first match did it live up to everything you thought it might be,i think we just keep doing what we're doing i think davis has done an unbelievable job of very very similar to strick at whistling straits last year he understands he has really really good players and he's taking information in that he needs and sees fit but he fully understands and thinks that we are capable of playing well enough on the course it's almost just kind of like a stay out of the way type thing this is when you're playing and just make sure you get to the tee on time kind of thing he's been great all the captains have been great in terms of what we can do we just have to keep playing golf we have to keep the pedal to the metal and try to get as many points as we can win each session and every single person on our team that goes out tries to win a point if we all do that then it will be good enough,0
jordan spieth,0,2022-09,2022,181,1,0,1,no microphone,i think it's a really good golf course this would be in my rotation every year if it weren't for the dallas events right after followed with the pga and memorial it's just a tough part of the schedule hopefully i can work it in in the future if you're playing well you're going to play well if you're not it's going to show its teeth the rough being down a little bit will make the shots look a little easier but bermuda with lower rough sometimes plays hard or harder because you miss lies you think it's not going to jump and it does or vice versa i think it's going to be a great test the course is in unbelievable condition as we probably expected it to be we'll probably get a couple different we'll see a golf course playing really short maybe thursday and then that weather will come in we'll get it really cold and maybe playing a bit longer after the cold front comes in so two different winds two different golf courses in a way,0
jordan spieth,0,2022-09,2022,133,0,1,1,no microphone,i haven't felt that way at all obviously if you think about both teams and you look at previous the previous cup and recognizing that three or four guys from each team are now with liv and not here not to mention there's some other guys who didn't make this team that were on the last team like myself who wasn't on the last team and is on this one so that turnover happens so it doesn't feel super odd because i think this is my fourth of this and i played four ryder cups there's teams that looked a lot different over the nine years so i don't feel that i thought much about it until you asked that but there's certainly some guys that have been a stable that aren't here,0
jordan spieth,0,2022-09,2022,104,0,1,1,no microphone,no not necessarily i love sebastian it would be fun yeah we played the final round of the byron nelson this year we were contending i've always respected his game and he lives in dallas and i play with him sometimes there so it would be awesome it would be fun we'd have a lot of laughs with sebastian then someone like adam adam scott would be really fun to play against he's the veteran in this whole situation right he's the veteran he and hideki are the veterans on their team that would be fun i don't know if they'll be a team,0
jordan spieth,0,2022-08,2022,143,1,0,1,obviously jay made a big announcement today just interested in your thoughts on the changes he announced and how you see that affecting the tour down the line,well i think it's great i think that to every single member of the pga tour it's going to be really good as the details start to unfold and everything gets figured out most importantly i think that players coming together to continue to want to make the pga tour better in the ways that we're trying to figure out how to do so i think is really the silver lining here i think that we all wanted to make the product better so we wanted to get together to do that with tiger and rory helping run the show and i thought it was really great i listened to jay's remarks and i feel like the pga tour has a lot of momentum right now i feel like it was very forward looking feels like there's a lot of momentum with it,0
jordan spieth,0,2022-08,2022,102,1,1,1,do we have today's announcement without liv golf,well i think certainly it's impossible to not think that that was a catalyst for continuing to want to make sure that our the players that we have on the pga tour now stay on the pga tour would this have gone that direction this soon maybe not but to say that it wouldn't have happened in general i'm not sure but i think that that certainly has been a catalyst for looking at the product as a whole and figuring out how to make it the best it can possibly be and maximize the strength of fields at the biggest events,0
jordan spieth,0,2022-08,2022,123,1,0,1,i think i don't have your words specific and several other players like it about a year ago or so were saying that competition at the end of this it's going to make it better is that what's happened,i think that it's going to be i think the pga tour with the remarks jay made today and the proposed changes and what changes come from that and i think in general it's just going to be in the best place it's ever been for a long time going forward i don't even know if that leaves there to be much competition down the road personally competition i guess is always good to help push each other but i'd rather have the competition just be us against what could possibly be better and better on the pga tour your competition is the best version of yourself kind of thing within the organization i think that that would be the best case scenario,0
jordan spieth,0,2022-08,2022,79,1,1,1,sadly yes,yeah i think that's the whole point is trying to figure out where that number is how to make sure that it fits everybody's schedules so that we can continue to try and deliver the best product possible with the pga tour running the show to make it possible i think that's including the majors when you say events so that's less events than i play right now i would be inclined to still play other events as well,0
jordan spieth,0,2022-08,2022,161,1,0,1,rory has been very outspoken out in front of all of this you seem to have taken a slightly lower profile are you happy that he's sort of emerged as a spokesperson,honestly as long as what we're setting out to get done gets done it does not matter to me whatsoever i'll be as useful as i'm wanted and as behind the scenes as i'm wanted to be honest with you it's all about what's going to be best to be honest i don't think it hurts for me to be a little bit more vocal going forward i may be so but i'm kind of i rolled off the pga tour board and rory took my spot and therefore he's more in the middle of a lot of it and then obviously having tiger's influence that doesn't need to be explained he's stepped into a position where he's more in the know with a lot more knowledge on pga tour matters than even the members have and his and tiger's kind of leadership through the whole thing but everyone's input has been what's really helped push this agenda forward and quickly,0
jordan spieth,0,2022-08,2022,275,1,1,1,some players have suggested that the tour changes are essentially copying the liv model that many people had decried earlier do you think that's a fair critique,i think that i still see a lot of differences don't you it's holes i think that in general in sports it makes sense to try and get the more players in any sport that people want to watch if you can get them playing at the same time in competition it makes sense i think the majors have the highest ratings with the players championship and then from there it drops significantly depending on if tiger is playing or in contention somewhere the idea that you can that as players we can collaborate and get together to produce a better product while having stiffer and better competition i think that that would be something that is i think that's just something in general that makes a lot of sense it'll create a better product for us going forward and i just don't believe that it's there's no teams this is still pga tour golf it's just trying to get i think it's going to be way better for the fans i think networks will be happier i think in general we are going to try and get as many of the highest ranked players that you can get all playing as often as they can together and it just seems like that's the way things should have been all along but it takes all the players getting together and when you're able to pick your own schedule outside of the four events everyone plays everyone plays the players at then the playoffs what realistically how often can we have this happen that's kind of i think what we're trying to settle on right now,0
jordan spieth,0,2022-08,2022,54,1,0,1,you're a decade removed from being this guy but do you have any issue potentially with like a young hotshot who's coming out of school gaining access to play against these top players in the world in these elevated events,they're going to have any ability that anybody else does once they earn their pga tour status going forward there's going to be nothing holding them back from being able to do so that i assume if has not been made clear are details that will be made clear to you guys going forward,0
jordan spieth,0,2022-08,2022,199,1,0,1,following up on what ryan said earlier about having the best players player together at the best tournaments it's an obvious conclusion to draw why has it taken so long why did it take this kind of existential threat to get to this point,i don't know i'm not sure i'm not sure what else could have provoked it or it's almost like things have been pretty good golf has been good right when tiger's dominance he ends up injured isn't playing for a little while he comes back and he wins the tour championship and then the masters you have new media rights deals around the same time covid hits not good for anybody golf numbers go up it's been in a good place it's almost like if it ain't broke don't fix it and it wasn't broke and it's just now there was maybe there's been seems like a time to a really good time to make some kind of a change also i think with the reserves the reserve situation and covid having to have those and then they get re built up by markets being built back up and pga tour's a lot of their separate business entities being really successful they get a situation where they can bump all these and continue to move this direction i think the timing just made sense and it was also provoked a little bit to be honest yeah i don't know,0
jordan spieth,0,2022-07,2022,232,0,1,1,what about world news for example do you feel a lack of it or do you find an interesting slant on it over here indeed how much attention do you pay to it while you're here,i'm not sure i've ever even played a practise round with him in this event i remember the first time i was ever paired with tiger in a major was saturday of the open was that liverpool royal liverpool and we teed off on the back nine i remember that's not like a great story that's really the extent of it but you never forget the first time you play with him in a major championship if you're able to do so i remember playing that saturday round i think we both had it going for a little while i think we both shot maybe or under and moved up the board quite a bit i could be wrong on that first hole was the par on no out there you don't really get split tees very often out here in the open that was the first time i'd heard of it other than that i don't have great stories of being involved obviously at carnoustie that was the only time i've ever been in a major where i looked at the first page of the leaderboard and saw his name and my name next to each other which was a dream come true and i just didn't well i guess neither one of us ended up holding the claret jug at the end of the day but that was pretty neat,0
jordan spieth,0,2022-07,2022,4,0,1,1,jordan what is your best tiger woods story from this championship through the years anything funny in a practise round,on that liverpool day,0
jordan spieth,0,2022-07,2022,127,1,0,1,every golfer wants to win in scotland what would it mean for you to win here at the home of golf,yeah i had to think i guess my open was in england so it wasn't in scotland i think links golf is arguably my favourite kind of golf and i don't know of any country that has more fantastic links courses than scotland obviously being the home of golf rich history it is the history in golf it would be meaningful to win scotland's national championship but the fact that it's now a co sanctioned dp world tour pga tour and rolex series event i think i just mentioned it earlier having said that it seems like it's one of the biggest international events of the year i'm just happy to be in position certainly a lot better position than i was when i finished yesterday's round,0
jordan spieth,0,2022-07,2022,7,1,0,1,no hole like at all on the pga tour,you tell me i've never seen one,0
jordan spieth,0,2022-07,2022,87,1,1,1,just before we let you go you yesterday once again reaffirmed your position with the pga tour and denying obviously the fact that you are in conversation with liv do you feel a need you can do that so you can focus on doing what your real job is,no i think i was just made aware after the round of some false reports and so at that point i think that maybe i had not been vocal enough so maybe just set the record straight it kind of stinks that anyone has to necessarily do it but it's not really a big deal i didn't think it was really that big of a deal certainly love competing and contending in these pga tour events and another one of those rounds tomorrow may get it done,0
jordan spieth,0,2022-05,2022,285,1,0,1,kind of out of left field gary patterson i know you're an avid longhorn fan how exciting is it that he's with texas now i know you've helped his charity during covid and whatnot but,yeah i guess that's all perspective i think if i was sitting here in having not won on the pga tour just getting my status and you told me in years you'd be sitting with this on your resume i'd obviously be pleased then if it was or and you told me this is on your resume now this is where you are in five years i'd probably be a little disappointed i think it just depends on what lens you look at it from what timetable you have overall i just feel really good about where i'm at right now i'm very focused on what the next years can look like if i accomplish what i'm setting out to accomplish and i'm still in the process of it right now and fortunately finding some consistency and success over the last year and a half while still not feeling like i have kind of the control and freedom through my game that i had for a few years there but i feel that the next run could be more exciting than any that i've ever had i believe in that i start to see that and more importantly i start to feel that through shots and i believe that a little bit of extra perspective a little bit probably more fearlessness less to lose that kind of thing going forward can only help me if i can get things right to where i want to and i think to me it feels like a matter of time while still being patient versus an if if i could duplicate the last years the next years i think that would be something i'd be really proud of,0
jordan spieth,0,2022-05,2022,181,1,0,1,what are your thoughts on kind of the corner of green tee some of the areas where there could be a bottleneck,green and i think more so it's tee over green and then tee box and tee box and then yeah there's a few of them major championships first two rounds play pretty slow so i think pace of play i'm assuming the pga of america will set up the golf course where you have pins more on the front of the green when the tees are back to hit over part of the green just for pace of play purposes last weekend was remarkably slow so i don't think we'll go any slower than we did last weekend and so i think it'll actually feel just fine i think those boxes were created for us to hit it in the areas that the course was designed to hit it in and we got two different wind directions so to have multiple options for tees where we hit it to those areas and play the golf course the way it's supposed to be played they need to be there i think there's a way to do it and they'll figure it out,0
jordan spieth,0,2022-05,2022,158,0,1,1,with phil is it strange not having the defending champion here this week and just the whole saudi golf story what's your take on the tenor that story has taken,you just went and threw two bombs at me since everyone was lobbing me questions you just went and threw two bombs yeah i think it's unfortunate phil is not here his accomplishment last year was insane one of the greatest accomplishments in the history of the game so i just think it's really unfortunate that as the defending champion he's not here hopefully things can just get back to normal and everybody can kind of get back to the way things were the saudi league or the liv league everybody can do what they want to do no players are standing in any players' way if they want to go go i love where i'm at i've been saying that for a long time weeks like last week are what i enjoy the most and i'm excited to come here this week and just keep my head down and none of those distractions weigh on me whatsoever,0
jordan spieth,0,2022-05,2022,106,1,0,1,obviously you won your last start you're a stroke back going into sunday here and the pga is on deck how would you sum up this stretch that you have right now,a lot of hard work i guess stepping back i'm just really pleased i've been very patient this year i felt like my game's been in a better place than last year and i didn't really have anything to show for it other than a second at pebble and then finally got kind of some really good breaks there that may have made up for some lipouts and such this year figure of speech there at hilton head so i feel some momentum for sure but i do feel like i still got some parts of my game that actually need to sharpen a little bit,0
jordan spieth,0,2022-05,2022,251,1,0,1,well of course but i mean is there something,i've taken three weeks off and won a major i played three weeks in and won i mean for me i don't i like to be sharp so i like to have played at least up close to a major i've never played into the u s open but i've played four weeks in a row before that week off prior to the u s open so my schedule has really not changed at all i don't look at it as i have to play the week before you would like to be a little sharp enough but if you play four weeks in a row and have one week of rest you should be sharp enough anyways this year i look forward to playing the week before the open championship something i haven't done since so i look forward to that at the scottish open and that opportunity to kind of play in some of that weather leading into the british and seeing what that can do for me so i feel good about it akron was always before the pga now it's the byron nelson before the pga so it really didn't change a whole lot for me but a lot of guys that didn't play the byron nelson now as you see we have a great field this year are choosing to come play into southern hills so that's obviously great for this tournament and i certainly enjoy that but it didn't change my schedule much at all,0
jordan spieth,0,2022-05,2022,5,1,0,1,we finally settled into this majors schedule the pga championship got moved to may a few years back but then covid hit things were all out of whack jt said i'm still trying to figure out my schedule like what works do you feel that way or do you feel like you've got this now with the pga championship in may and kind of what you need to do to prepare for all the majors,i like mavs in seven,0
jordan spieth,0,2022-05,2022,282,1,0,1,so you got to meet nadeshot after your pro am round so i guess if you could i don't know involved you are in the esports community or anything like that but if you want to just talk about what it was like to meet him and maybe anything that relates to gaming that you know of,i just i played it in the u s amateur but it changed so much and i was or years old so i just wanted to see it i wanted to take maybe some stress off practice rounds next week and be able to maybe do nine each day instead of feeling like i got to go out and learn a lot major championship practice rounds can take three and a half hours per nine so trying to knock out as much as you can ahead of time is really nice i thought the golf course was fantastic i loved it i think the green complexes are perfectly fitting to the holes there's going to be a lot the greens play maybe three quarters of the size that they actually are there's a lot more runoffs than i remember into bermuda chipping areas and into runoff areas that are mowed so you can be left with a lot of really delicate little shots and then they have that hydronic system that a lot of courses have adapted now where they can cool it off and make it firmer make the firmness whatever firmness they want so they have the ability to essentially control exactly what almost score to par that they want obviously weather dependent but i think it's going to be a really firm and fast pga and i think it's going to be one of the higher scoring pgas that we have seen now i did play it in mile an hour winds with justin so i saw it i saw the teeth of it so that could change but it was a great test i really enjoyed playing it,0
jordan spieth,0,2022-05,2022,165,0,1,1,second major knocking on the door in oklahoma in five or six days what did you take away from your recent round at southern hills,no jason dufner and his girlfriend and then justin and his fiance' and then their dog and our dog are good buds so i think in an ideal world he would stay closer to the course but i think he would have felt too guilty not staying at our house since we live here so that's kind of he didn't say that but that's probably how you know when he's driving home at rush hour i think he's probably like man you know all right i guess we got to go back there but it's a lot of fun we stay together probably more than half the tournaments in a season anyways now and so it's not really much different other than i get to sleep in my own bed but it's nice hanging out at night get to kind of show him around dallas a little bit and eat some good food and then we'll go on next week and do the same thing,0
jordan spieth,0,2022-05,2022,278,1,0,1,do you think it's an advantage to be able to have home tournament feel prior in your hometown prior to the masters or the pga,i think daniel berger's about as impressive as anybody around the greens and i guess if you just look at the stats it shows you that but i play a lot of rounds with him so i'm just saying off of random shots here or there that don't even go on the stats it's fun to watch him around the greens get the job done there's not many that aren't very good you kind of need that part of the game around here for your golf rounds to be able to shoot low scores so he's the first one that comes to mind as far as having to travel anywhere any kind of grass types a lot of times like next week is really grainy bermuda so if you grew up in texas florida or along the south you grew up on that grass and it's a different kind of chipping and putting and that's where you can see guys who aren't used to that struggle a little bit with that into the grain bermuda so i'm sure there will be a lot of guys on the chipping green trying to work a lot of those shots that you see like at memphis and you see there and places with that and even like albany down at tiger's event super grainy thick stranded bermuda so it's about as anything as hard as anything to chip off of that's why your greens in reg will be really important next week because you might be in position where even the best in the game with a wedge in their hand have to kind of hit a chip to or feet,0
jordan spieth,0,2022-05,2022,2,0,1,1,wanted to get your reaction to the news yesterday about the tour denying the waivers for the liv and you come from a background and experience on the pac and i'm sure you probably have a lot of discussions in there with other guys just your reaction and what other reactions you might have heard from other players,thank you,0
jordan spieth,0,2022-04,2022,230,1,0,1,jordan first there's a horde of rabid youth out there,it felt like a round of golf it felt like a sunday on the pga tour i mean it's just you compete and the first three rounds set up today and today is all about trying to close it out i want to say you know i thought if i made that putt on i just thought it was tricky enough the wind was shifting i knew somebody was at i think it was erik at one point and then it went to shane i just thought maybe with these closing holes i might i thought it was maybe for a playoff when i finished i heard shane was left on and then chipped it in the water and thought okay i really like having posted just because it's tricky but there's still some wedge opportunities for those guys coming in when shane harold and patrick all parred is when i really thought i was still in it because if they made a birdie there they just needed one on the last three and there was going to be essentially a wedge a iron and a iron so you'd think out of three guys that somebody might make a birdie on those three holes which patrick did but i dodged some bullets on and no one made birdies i think that was the difference maker there to trick people out,0
jordan spieth,0,2022-04,2022,279,1,0,1,having won here at such a young age and knowing how hard it is to win here how much has your level of appreciation increased with the passage of time of being a masters champion,i would say it's certainly i think the coolest accolade you can have as a golfer i continue to feel that way year in and year out i've had so many close finishes and top finishes that i'm honestly a little frustrated at not having more than one just given i think i finished in the top three like five or six times now out of eight starts so in that position enough i would have liked if you just take any tournament i'd want to be i'd want to have a couple wins at least just given you're in that position enough i don't feel that this tournament is the hardest to win by any means that we play all year i think that just based on the field size who's in the field how many out of the top hundred in the world versus say the players or the pga might be a more difficult tournament as far as compared to the other players to win but this has that added level of legacy to it that tournament we all grew up watching our generation watching tiger make those putts to win that really inspired us to want to we'd go right out to the th green with our buddies and pretend that we had that putt to win the masters for a month after he did it right it's just kind of if you can almost dumb it down to i'm just playing against these guys like i do every week then it makes you a little bit more comfortable then your original question to when you do win it does kind of create that legacy,0
jordan spieth,0,2022-04,2022,165,1,0,1,can you talk about the greens here how they play into your strength as a putter justin was in here talking about your unbelievable sense of speed your imagination i think it always seems to inspire you when you get here,i think so they don't have to trick anything out i think more and more on the pga tour we're seeing hole locations like the hole slopes here and they find the one little crown or they go on the crown of a ridge and you go here you just don't see that very often they're fast and firm and if you hit it to the right spot you've got a chance if you don't you've got to play defense i just really enjoy that i think the speed of the greens i enjoy faster greens and then yeah using my imagination like you said i've always worked really hard on speed control and ever since i went to cross handed back when i was maybe or years old it helped me a lot from shorter range but i needed to work on speed control so for a lot of years that was most of my work i think that's really helped in this tournament,0
jordan spieth,0,2022-03,2022,111,1,0,1,with the pga courses rotating around do you feel like this is one of your better pga chances to get a win and kind of complete the grand slam,i think on paper yes just given grass types winds are more similar to what i'm used to at home and it's about as close to home as we get for a pga at least until we go to frisco but yeah it'll be by far the closest pga i've played to home and the best chances i've had are when courses are played with wind and firmer conditions at pga championships it's may versus august i feel like august has a better chance of being dry and hot but as long as it doesn't get soaked i certainly would prefer to see a course firmer and faster and more challenging,0
jordan spieth,0,2022-03,2022,27,1,0,1,people talk a lot about kind of mixing up the variety of the tour schedule adding more match play then you have a team event at zurich i'm curious if there's any room for maybe a little bit more unique stuff maybe like a skins game or a lot of guys play wolf at home do you see any of that working because a lot of guys do play wolf when you're back playing,yeah i don't think that would follow under the guidelines of we can't gamble while we play in pga tour events so that would be a tough,0
jordan spieth,0,2022-03,2022,176,1,0,1,fedexcup points,gamble with fedexcup points i think i highly doubt that's the case in a pga tour event going forward i'm not on the pac or the board anymore so whatever they're planning i've got no idea but i don't foresee that we may even be moving out of match play into more stableford type stuff where you get bigger advantages for eagles and stuff like that just to have full fields on the weekend for these sponsors that pay a lot of money and sometimes you end up with four people around on the weekend or on sundays i think if anything it might go the other direction before the one you're talking about unless you're talking about the fall bringing in some fun charitable aspect to it i think going back to the shell's wonderful world of golf type stuff back in the day i think we might be seeing a lot of that coming in the future but i don't see it being a part of the january to august fedexcup schedule at all,0
jordan spieth,0,2022-03,2022,27,1,0,1,i asked scottie and coach fields this but if your texas team faced scottie's team that had beau hossler doug ghim gavin hall and taylor funk and you played in a match play who would win,i think we would but we have two guys on the pga tour right now and they've got three four scottie beau doug who rounded it out,0
jordan spieth,0,2022-02,2022,100,0,1,1,how do you explain to your wife when you talk to her,i'm not really sure what's going to happen there i just saw the blimp shot from overhead and it really bothered me so i can't imagine while she was watching that live they actually came out my son was out for the first time ever on and and i don't know where they went from there and i don't know if they were over off the at t hospitality or anything so yeah i mean my parents are here too so not only do i have to explain to my wife i got to explain to my mom my dad,0
jordan spieth,0,2022-02,2022,85,1,1,1,you said you were sick for a couple of weeks you had this thing kind of ongoing,no i was walking differently and very much not very much not involved in a lot of the holes that i played and i think that i mean my parents even they were like yeah you just did not look like yourself on whatever pga tour live or whatever i mean the first the last like three holes of the first round i was just trying to get in the house and then pretty much the whole second round was a tough go for me,0
jordan spieth,0,2022-02,2022,118,0,1,1,it's going to be a tough one for you but patrick was talking about the walker cup and you were playing a match and everyone kind of looking out the tunnel you got to the first tee early and he said jordan had a look about him that you just knew he was going to win we asked him what the look was he couldn't describe it would you happen to know what he was talking about,i don't know maybe impatience i mean i felt like i was playing well but i was frustrated that we were losing and knew that i needed to get a point so i know i was just kind of like frustrated with how the week had gone as a team because our team was so stacked and should have on paper just been a blow out and they were the underdogs playing like underdogs and i just i played andy sullivan and it was a pretty good match and then i made a couple long putts and closed the match out but i don't remember the first hole i remember like a few holes on the back nine,0
jordan spieth,0,2022-01,2022,139,1,0,1,MODERATOR,yeah this is qualifying for this tournament is obviously a number one goal on the year you want to win on the pga tour and in order to get here you have to do that so i've always embraced the opportunity to come down here to hawaii and i've had solid success at kapalua as well so not only does it turn into a really fun and easy week given the size of the field and the weather compared to mainland but it's also an opportunity to get off to a good start to the season and it's done a lot for me in the past to when i've played well at this event to feel like you you move up in the fedexcup you start to get into a rhythm as you go and hit the west coast,0
jordan spieth,0,2022-01,2022,111,0,1,1,MODERATOR,yeah i think that will be something as people have multiple kids and they're in school and then you got to balance a lot more right now it's so early that there's not a whole lot i can provide as far as annie keeps the kid alive essentially so i help when i can and for the most part he's still sleeping most of the days but it's going really well it's been a lot of fun just in how much things have changed over the last couple months so i'm excited to see what this year entails and we plan on traveling together and it should be a fun journey,0
jordan spieth,0,2022-01,2022,192,1,0,1,i know you haven't obviously been a father for very long but has it helped maybe like focus the time you have to work on your game but also to be at home and being a dad does it some guys have said that becoming a father helps them focus their practice time a little bit better when they're at home,i'm honestly just trying to get back to my dna i got away from that and i was swinging in front of my body and just there's a lot of specifics i guess but i'm really just kind of looking back to my dna from high school college into the first few years on tour and really just trying to map stuff to there recognizing that your body changes and not everything's going overlap but as far as the big components really being able to get through the ball committed threw the ball get kind of my body working better where your body's hitting it and you're not relying as much on your hands it's really hard to play on the pga tour trying to rely on timing and it's very hard to stay consistent for four rounds so last year i saw myself play a lot of tournaments where i was very consistent for four rounds and to me that meant that and a lot of times it wasn't with great putting sometimes it was i think that those were steps in the right direction that just continued to build confidence,0
jordan spieth,0,2022-01,2022,204,1,0,1,what's the biggest thing that you are working on in your swing like what would you say is the biggest key in trying to make these transitions,well i think certainly it's a threat to the pga tour i think as a player overall it will benefit in that i think that the changes that have come from the pga tour have been modernized in a way to that may or may not have come about if it weren't there so i think for us players on the pga tour i think that so far it's been something that has kind of helped the pga tour sit and say hey where can we look to satisfy our membership and potentially make some changes going forward that where there's some similarities potentially to a league like that but while maintaining kind of the integrity the c category that the pga tour has and i think that going forward i mean i guess we'll have to see but for me to sit here and i mean i can only say from my point of view i think that it's been beneficial to the players to have competition and i think the tour would say that they probably feel that they're in a better position going forward by having to sit back and kind of take a look at things and make some changes,0
jordan spieth,0,2021-09,2021,169,1,0,1,granted we're playing next to a lake and not an ocean and the rough won't be super long but visually there are some similarities between this and some courses overseas you mentioned having to flight it in the wind and using some slopes where do you put this course on the continuum of hazeltine or valhalla like an open championship layout where does it rank,yeah it's an american links isn't it it's played from the air though you're not bouncing balls up to these greens it's played from the air but you also have to hit shots versus driving range shots you have uneven lies that you have to work maybe against them or with them hold winds ride winds i think it's an american links i don't think that i mean we had americans finish one two at the open championship this year i don't really think that it makes that much of a difference on the style of course i think our team our captains strick and the vice captains are trying to figure out ways that maybe fit the players specifically on our team as far as rough cuts and fairway cuts where they are and green speeds and firmness and that kind of stuff it's an aerial links so you still have to play very similar golf to what we experience on the pga tour for the most part,0
jordan spieth,0,2021-08,2021,106,1,0,1,are you bummed that he didn't make the putt on,i might have been the first person to play with two s on the pga tour had he made it so i was kind of rooting for that i played with justin when he shot it yeah i mean obviously when you can witness history it's pretty cool especially when i'm at under and not towards the lead if i was towards the lead you always want to be closer to the lead but the shots he hit today the putts he made under is on most of the golf courses we play i wouldn't consider it any worse than some other s people have shot,0
jordan spieth,0,2021-08,2021,247,1,0,1,talking about getting over things i'm just curious what was going through your brain when you went to the th tee in the final round at northern trust last week after what happened on and how long does it take you to get over something like that,i mean that one was a weird one because i actually felt like i was hitting it better that day than the other days and that's to my point exactly on unless you're out there like if you're not michael or me you don't know that you see the scores it wasn't very hard because i really had nothing to lose at that point like i could make five birdies or five bogeys it wasn't going to make any difference really whatsoever as far as regrouping to finish the round but i just wanted to hit i just wanted to make good swings hit good shots i think it was maybe a couple holes later where i just said let's get into next week prep mode it's monday let's try and make progress on what i need to make progress on regardless of results and kind of went into the whole monday round like that it wasn't working very well so i just kind of adjusted a little i think i feel like it's a once every couple years hopefully it's a round where you just you're lagging a putt on the last hole to break out here on the pga tour and i feel like it happens to just about everybody and i actually walked away from it more upset that i had three over par rounds than i cared about the actual monday round itself i just want to be a little bit better consistently,0
jordan spieth,0,2021-08,2021,216,1,0,1,what does it mean to you personally to be a part of baltimore's first pga tour event in nearly years,well for me personally i have the under armour connection a brand that started out of kevin's grandma's basement and has grown into a pretty special place for this city and done a lot for the city grown a lot of the areas around the marina or the bay i'm not exactly sure what you so i've come here dozens of times over the last eight years and been able to come out here but also spend quite a bit of time around headquarters and in the city so i've always i think it's a cool opportunity to come back to a place that i one of the places i've visited the most in the last years and play a pga tour event it's far from home but kind of feels more like i've got family around me in a way for me personally it's special but going to new cities that are good markets where you get good crowds and a lot of interest i think is very important and it's something the tour tries to do i think the bmw championship itself does a great job of trying to find that and we've played a lot of different places all the way from denver to here to philly to chicago area hopefully that continues,0
jordan spieth,0,2021-07,2021,150,0,1,1,you just mentioned that you feel like you've been able to summon form even when you haven't been playing well coming into open championships why do you think that is,i think it brings a lot of the feel aspect into the game i think i shorten swings up over here and hit more punch shots and just stuff that i probably should be doing at home when i'm trying to you get less swing focused and more shot focused over here because the second you take your brain off of what you're hitting you may not find your ball there's a instead of just a driving range shot in palm springs there's always some shot you have to play that gives you a little bit of an advantage or certain club selections based on you hit a fade or a draw they go to yards different distances than between which shot you play i guess to sum that up there's a lot of external factors over here and i think that external is where i need to be living,0
jordan spieth,0,2021-07,2021,260,1,0,1,i'm curious if i'm not mistaken you haven't played for a few weeks leading into this week and you did the same thing in ' if i'm not mistaken i'm wondering if there was a conscious effort to redo what you did there when you had success and as a second question there what were your expectations coming in getting into the round when you hadn't played competitively in a few weeks,yeah that was kind of my one concern i think coming in here i felt pretty good about the work that i had done over the last say week and a half or so but when you haven't played for a little while you come into a difficult track you can have a bit of rust early and i was a little bit concerned about that i think midway through the front nine today kind of turning under par was just big to feel like hey we're in the thick of things there's just a little extra nerves when you're not coming off the week before just getting started and hit some really good shots early in the round today which i think was important no i don't i've played the week before in ' and then i think i was off at least two or three weeks every year since won at birkdale had a chance to win playing the week before in ' and had a chance at carnoustie it just so happens in the schedule that i end up playing a lot in the spring with dallas and fort worth and now with the schedule shifted around with the pga championship in there by the time the u s open is done i'm pretty gassed and looking for a little break so i think it's more the break before it versus the preparation for here but i'll certainly look into i think playing into the open championship going forward thinking that it could be really good prep,0
jordan spieth,0,2021-06,2021,113,1,0,1,is it harder or easier to come to a major event that you play regularly knowing that you already have the ingrained knowledge or would you rather go to a spot where everyone's kind of starting with a clean slate,i think at this point being eighth or ninth year out here i'd rather it be this scenario i feel like you can have especially when the course plays relatively similar it's one of the more difficult higher scoring averages in a pga tour event i think the fact it doesn't change a whole lot your game plan's pretty much the same you're trying to hit the center of the greens and work from there you're watching out for some of the harder holes trying to put the ball on in two and walk off with four i think in this case i like that there's course knowledge versus learning a new place,0
jordan spieth,0,2021-06,2021,200,0,1,1,now the one question i wanted to ask that's horrific and you have to blame jack for it because he talked about this as well if you look back at your career what is the ratio of memory on your great shots or your bad ones which ones are you more likely to remember more clearer or however i would phrase that,yeah let's see i tried sectionals i don't know if i tried it in i got through in as an alternate and then made it through in in qualifying and i would say you don't want to go in expecting the number to be higher than you think but it just always is i mean it's just it seems to be if you think it's going to take under it's going to take it's just one of those like if you just play consistent golf patiently take advantage of the holes it's just it's a difficult day because you just don't know and you normally don't have live score boards and you don't then get to situationally play the back nine of that second round when you may want to not take on a hole that a drivable hole when you can hit a wedge in and protect par so it's just kind of i think the unknowns are the most difficult part but if you just stay as patient as you can and limit the number of bogeys typically you make enough birdies to get through that's i guess what i can take away from my experiences with it,0
jordan spieth,0,2021-05,2021,163,1,0,1,how drastic is the turnaround from the state of the putting at the pga to here,i don't think we've ever played on paspalum greens so that was one adjustment they were slower because of how windy it was and it was just kind of hard to commit to starting a ball outside the hole from five or six feet and having to hit it that hard you just feel like you're going to miss them all high so i ended up babying some putts and lipping out on the other side a lot i just got here and just felt more committed from really the first few putts of the first round but i needed to work on some significant stroke feels as well and i think the combination of just being on surfaces i'm used to and then also the work that was done just in three days' time and a little work at that given the weather we had has been very nice but i'm still able to work that feel as much as i can,0
jordan spieth,0,2021-05,2021,375,1,0,1,you felt that phil could close the deal on sunday what was your reaction to how he did that also just can you speak a little bit about his longevity in the game,i thought it would be very very difficult he hadn't been in contention in quite a while on the pga tour against the guys he was in contention with right i know he's won many times on the champions tour and i think he might i haven't heard anything he said afterwards but i think that might have been something that had been helpful for him as he's coming down the stretch just having won golf tournaments the last couple of years regardless of where it is i think that helped but it's just so difficult to be in contention for the first time in a while and be able to tap into that confidence that you're supposed to be there and you're supposed to win it seems like all the great ones have that one left at the end and i know he'll probably tell you maybe he thinks he's got more than one left i don't think anybody will doubt him after this one but i think it's just wild i think it's incredible his streak of not being outside the top in the world for however long that was is going to be a very difficult task for anybody going forward to match and then to win a tournament let alone a major championship at with how young and stacked the game has gotten is just an incredible feat i think the way he handled saturday and sunday when he did make mistakes to especially on the back nine on saturday to then close that back out and remain in the lead it was typical phil there was going to be some excitement and when he got in trouble he got out of it all in all it was a very difficult golf course in the wind where you've got to drive the ball very well and then control iron shots i think that he automobile did it better than anybody else but the one thing out there if you do get into trouble there's no one else you'd rather have hitting that shot from a tough spot around the greens and i think that kind of scrambling and making some putts early in that tournament was a difference maker for him,0
jordan spieth,0,2021-05,2021,161,1,0,1,you mentioned coming off of majors week it was a couple years ago where there was a major put between the colonial and nelson and then you've got the u s open here in a few weeks talk about the adjustment to that schedule i know last year threw everything out of whack but how different does it make the dynamics of the schedule for you,again i don't mind it because i'm home for two of them if they're back to back versus two weeks apart i actually don't feel much of a difference there i don't mind it the way it is now and i didn't mind it before it's nice because i'm able to play in tour events try to win pga tour events but also be at home and almost like i kind of get that ability to have your own just it takes less out of you when you're not traveling so having a couple majors mixed in there and then obviously next week is a big event as well i actually really like this part of the season for major prep and for ability to play well in these hometown events it's a stretch that i very much enjoyed i've had pretty good success with this part of the schedule and just looking to try and build on that this year,0
jordan spieth,0,2021-05,2021,171,0,1,1,jordan it seemed like there was a bit of frustration there on and and then you come here at th green and deliver what is now like the jordan special at th green at at t byron nelson walk us through that putt going in for eagle on,yeah i needed to get it out to the right the fall line coming onto the green was out to the right side i was probably four five feet out i had a spot out there and hit it a little harder than i would've normally i had had a couple fringe putts earlier in the round and they came off really bouncy and slow we're just not used to the zoysia so i went out and just hit it a little harder once it got on the green it looked good started the putter raise and i wasn't positive it was going in because the angle it was coming in at i wanted to do the no look to the crowd but i mean it was a really cool moment starting to feel a little bit normal once you get to the last few holes it's always fun to have especially in dallas but anywhere just to get the roars and feed off of them maybe some confidence into tomorrow,0
jordan spieth,0,2021-05,2021,128,1,0,1,MODERATOR,no i don't think so i would have much rather gotten my card and played the entire season on the pga tour it would have been a little easier i think clearly went well but it was also kind of the springtime on so i missed the first three months of pga tour events that i would have been able to have had i gotten through final stage obviously that's more challenging than second stage so i remember hitting like out of greens and just couldn't putt it in the ocean and then worked a lot on my putting that off season and then started to really make some and have some good finishes the next spring and it got me status and running on the pga tour,0
jordan spieth,0,2021-05,2021,204,1,0,1,could you give a few more details on the covid when did you get it how bad was it are there still any lingering affects of it and when did you start getting healthy,i think was really the first time was really the only time where i where it may have weighed on me only given it was coming right off of a major win and then i was playing really well kind of week in and week out there so i felt in form i felt like i was i felt a favorite going in and it was the last major and then the years after i just didn't really feel in great form in pgas i mean it's going to pick you apart if you're not driving the ball straight and far and then for the most of the golf courses and then it's normally narrower fairways thicker rough longer golf courses and so that's really the only year i felt that i mean even in contention in i was certainly trying i knew every year i go into that tournament it's like it's the one that if i could pick one more to win i would pick that one but it doesn't really while i'm playing the tournament it hasn't really hit me and added any pressure or anything like that it just kind of excites me a little bit more going into it,0
jordan spieth,0,2021-05,2021,9,1,0,1,i was thinking some of us would like to quarantine away from our wives at times but that's another story two random ones for you this will be next week will be the fifth time you've gone to a pga with that being the missing major if you're being honest with yourself did you give it much thought up until the time you got ready to tee it off did it weigh on you and is it any different this year,no i mean that should be funny enough right,0
jordan spieth,0,2021-05,2021,28,1,0,1,next week's pga it's going to allow rangefinders obviously i'm curious two things from your perspective what's your opinion on them being allowed and secondly if you and mike plan to use one or not use one,yeah i had a positive test and i took two more and they were both positive as well so i thought at that point it was probably correct,0
jordan spieth,0,2021-05,2021,150,1,0,1,i was wondering how did you know you had covid were you tested did you go to a clinic,yeah yeah i mean i've been careful anytime i'm around a group of people i've been trying to be outside for really the reason being one i don't really want to get it and two i don't really want to miss tournament weeks so yeah it's just kind of odd that it but i mean there's been like you said there's been a lot of people that have gotten it it's not really in my opinion it's not really a big deal it's certainly been a big deal for a lot of people i'm not downplaying that i'm just saying as far as the pga me getting it you know i'm one of very many of who have gotten it and you just go about the process of what you're supposed to do stay home stay away from people wait until you get cleared and then go back to work,0
jordan spieth,0,2021-05,2021,1,1,0,1,this was a home test not a pga tour test,yes,0
jordan spieth,0,2021-05,2021,94,0,1,1,and you just stayed at home and kind of just kept to yourself is that was that your routine,yeah because this is four in a row for me and so that was going to be a nice and i've had a lot of success there i like the golf course there so i was really bummed it was tough watching it knowing that i had been playing well and i would go to a course that i like a lot but that's unfortunately part of the world we live in right now so i don't think i would have been a hundred percent last week so decided to wait until this week,0
jordan spieth,0,2021-05,2021,388,0,1,1,but you weren't going to play new orleans either were you entered or were you thinking about playing at charlotte,so in the first time the tour event was there in tokyo i was paired with hideki and adam scott the first two rounds i remember walking off the first tee talking to adam and being like and adam is someone who has spent a lot of time in japan he's loved going over there he's seen a lot and he's played probably more than just about anybody not japanese in japanese tour events as far as a name that you would recognize he said i remember him saying i've never seen anything like this i mean it was six deep the entire first fairway people on they bring little stools they would bring like stools and then have the what are they called that you look through i mean it was just it was probably the biggest thursday crowd and most like maybe most exciting most nerve wracking crowd i had ever played in front of on like a thursday and friday it was bizarre and then i can only imagine obviously what this masters impact has had over there i haven't seen anything from when he arrived there or anything he's been doing but man it just it's got to be the coolest feeling for him i mean i felt like it was the coolest feeling for me but i didn't have a whole country that lives and dies with each swing that i make and for that to happen i mean it was i was obviously wanting to win being in contention there but i mean i could certainly relate to how he must feel to an extent but i mean over there yeah i've seen him over there and it's next level stuff i mean it's like playing with tiger at the u s open at pebble and i know this is not or even the mid s but i thought that was next level stuff playing there with tiger but it was it was wild and then obviously he was he and tiger were the ones that went at it and tiger ended up winning there and so even though saturday and sunday i was not at the same score to par as they were it's a smaller golf course you can see and it was just i mean it was just crazy,0
jordan spieth,0,2021-04,2021,203,0,1,1,what did you see for your second shot on,from here not much but from where i was i saw that if i just kind of kept it low to the ground i just needed the tree that it hit if i missed that tree i thought worst case it's just going to hit some branches and kind of just go through to be honest i wasn't going to gain a whole lot versus punching straight out i thought i'd gain yards and have a wedge into that pin and that's why i made that decision but it's so tough when you're standing up looking into a tree as a right hander and trying to miss it on the right side i think that's why i just leaned it out to the right live and learn i think it's tough to swallow because knowing the golf course is very difficult and i was under par punch it to the fairway you make a bogey you're at even par at the turn that's a pretty good score but unfortunately i'm still in that like under mode from last week and trying to capitalize on and gain every stroke i can lucky i've kind of gotten away with that and still in the tournament,0
jordan spieth,0,2021-04,2021,219,0,1,1,MODERATOR,yeah i've certainly pulled down this morning not long ago when you're coming in form it's a good feeling when you arrive here and i've had that a few times i've had it where i pulled down after missing a cut or played well not leading up to it and still played well here too i love being here i love being on the grounds it's my favorite tournament in the world i've expressed that many times in here yesterday was a great day that was a lot of fun being in contention having the putts kind of go in as i've mentioned over the last six weeks or so you put yourself in that position enough times the bounces will go your way that's kind of the motto i've always lived by just try to be in form as often as you can and consistent as you can and you end up holding the trophy at the end every once in a while and it was a while since the last time it happened and we got in late and didn't really have the normal celebrations in order that you would have after a win certainly with this around the corner so it's about trying to certainly soak it in but get refocused for the year's first major,0
jordan spieth,0,2021-04,2021,307,0,1,1,given the struggles you've discussed at length what are the biggest factors that have gotten you to this level and what specifically is the difference between this level and what you just said the next level,a lot of it is the mechanics of my golf swing i was fighting some changes whether it be injury to just ignorance to i mean i'm trying to do stuff myself and i just got off mechanically to where i essentially was late into the golf ball and just had bad inconsistent deliveries that led to inconsistent golf and had to save stuff with my hands so i've just done a better job of cleaning up transition into the ball to where i've got it more on plane into the golf ball and shallowed and in a better position to not have to rely on timing as much but it's probably i don't know i would say a little over halfway to where i mean i can tap into i'm making some swings each week where i'm like man that was from mid backswing right in transition i'm like that's going to be a missile right at the pin and i'm trying to tap into what that timing phase is and continue down the path of reversing thousands of swings and doing the wrong thing into pushing the agenda that i'm on right now into where i can get it to be most of the swings that feel like that that's for everybody that's not just me that's what everyone is trying to do on the range this week is tap into their dna where they where they have struck the ball the best and where they have putted the best and figure out how to get into that frame of mind and that timing as they step on the first tee thursday so i just got further off than normally professionals get and so it's been a climb back and i feel on the right path but there's still a lot of work to go,0
jordan spieth,0,2021-03,2021,84,0,1,1,was it kind of nice to obviously not hometown here but you went to school here playing in front of the fans back here in austin,yeah it was great the support here is as good as dallas i mean it's pretty awesome it makes me feel like i'm home even though i only lived here for a year and a half and periodically during that time it's awesome i mean just austin texas is such a beautiful place and it's just fun driving around this area and going to restaurants that i've missed going to and try and spend more time going forward in this city i love it,0
jordan spieth,0,2021-03,2021,134,1,0,1,when you're playing a course this week where you're trying to learn things about the golf course will that take some of your mind off of what you're trying to do as far as your swing and you said that you thought about your swing too many times does this help in any way to get through that,no i was just mentioning two tournaments two of maybe the only tournaments on the pga tour schedule that i haven't played before so i was just i was referencing the florida swing the similarities between this week and that week in scoring in tournaments that i would like to play normally if the schedule weren't the way it was and i didn't play events in texas leading up to the masters and the west coast and all that so i was just referencing those and i'm not sure i mean i'm kind of out here definitely planning on this week and next week and then i've just got to pick a plan from there based on how i'm feeling and what i want the obviously the plan to be going into the masters,0
jordan spieth,0,2021-03,2021,288,1,0,1,secondly when you consider where we are right now in terms of where we were a year ago pandemic related and the role that you play and the information you know etcetera what surprises you and what doesn't about where golf is right now,yeah i think i mean there's a lot that surprises me i know after being on those calls there was a lot of concern about whether we would be able to play golf in and beyond and the plans that were set in place the safety measures they got the players but also the staff and the tournaments to feel comfortable coming out and taking what risk there was and is to bring golf back was significant and certainly can't be overlooked by all the people involved in allowing it to happen and making it happen i think personally when i look back i just i give a lot of props to jay monahan for the work that he put in and a lot of times it's a little it's it's easier to see how good a leader is when you're in tough times than when you're in good times and i thought that when i look back i mean if i could have had anymore respect for jay monahan i think i speak for most of the players in saying that this last year has proved that we have phenomenal leadership and i think clearly everybody there was a hesitation with a couple players as we came back to golf and then it seems like everybody has really embraced the roles now as we start to almost work our way back towards normal towards normalcy at these events with allowing fans this week next week and certainly that will be kind of the next stage to see how that works but there's not much that i'm surprised with a lot of it with how successful june of last year until now has been with the pga tour,0
jordan spieth,0,2021-03,2021,307,0,1,1,black friday,yeah i mean i would have loved to have played in this event every year as i explained earlier just unfortunately and that's the same case with other people with the byron nelson or even jack's event but i don't it goes without explaining how important arnold palmer jack nicklaus byron nelson ben hogan now tiger woods hosting an event are to where the game is now where it's come from and where it's going forward i think all you want to do is just give a big thank you to these players obviously with arnie passing but anytime you see jack or tiger you just want to say thank you for continuing to boost this sport and at a professional level further and further and allowing us the opportunities that we have being around here i'm going to go look through arnold's office for the first time after this which will be really neat for me i was very fortunate to be able to meet and spend a little bit of time with arnold palmer before he passed and certainly was a role model and should be for all professional golfers in the way that not only he kind of taught us how to be our own brand and be able to go out and seek he was the first one to really go out and seek endorsements and kind of look at himself as a brand but also the way he treated people and the way that he was he had arnie's army and the way that he was involved and he knew he was an entertainer and lived it to its fullest while still being a fierce competitor i mean if you're speaking to arnie specifically that's what i think of and it's phenomenal that we continue to have tournaments that honor these legends,0
jordan spieth,0,2021-02,2021,191,1,0,1,you mentioned the interaction with daniel you guys are obviously good friends you were chatting a lot today you have some history obviously the bunker shot and then what's it like to go against someone like that in this setting and what will tomorrow be like,it's cool we're the same age and we have known each other and been playing against each other since we were and there's a dozen of us in the same class out here on the pga tour so any chance to line up across from it even patrick cantlay's a year older but we have been playing against each other sundays we were so it's really cool when you kind of know somebody and you know what they have gone through to get out here and how hard they have worked and the success they have had and you just kind of have that respect for the work ethic that it takes and the talent and skill level that it takes with your peers to be able to be on a sunday a dream come true scenario to have a chance to win a pga tour event so when he made the putt on the last hole i think that secured him in the last group i'm not positive it's fun i want to play with him again and battle it out and we had a good time today out there,0
jordan spieth,0,2021-02,2021,116,1,0,1,you're used to not playing in front of spectators but here without amateurs obviously you saw that coming when you're out there did it just seem odd,a little bit it almost having played the u s open recently here that was threesomes the first two days the golf course is obviously quite a bit different but just having had that in the last year or so it's almost like we have played we have played as many rounds with three pga tour players as we have in the pro am in the last couple years so it was odd i certainly miss how much fun we have with jake and dustin and wayne every year so i'll shoot jake a note saying that i could have used his help for another couple strokes but all in all very pleased with the start,0
jordan spieth,0,2021-02,2021,359,1,0,1,MODERATOR,yeah it was a nice confidence boost i love that i trusted what i was working on all four rounds knowing that it wasn't necessarily going to fully be there and i think that kind of trust and that belief just pays off i mean when you stick to something and you start working at it it feels a little better each day that you do it when you're doing it correctly but even more so you just think kind of the golf gods will reward you for and that's what happened on saturday the chip in and some long made putts at the end but i think that was more just kind of just a reward for kind of the work that i've been putting in and it was really nice to see a low round like that and to be able to continue to take it deeper and deeper as the day went on so rounds like that are big confidence boosters because going low no matter where you are on the pga tour is very difficult to do then very disappointed off of sunday i just i know standing on the first tee that i don't necessarily have the control that i've had other weeks where i've been in that same position but i knew it was close enough where i could get the job done i just didn't make anything i just didn't adjust to the speed of the greens i left a lot of putts short not even off of i had nerves to start but i didn't really feel the nerves on the greens i just didn't adjust to the speed like i did the day before that's really what it came down to i think i had putts because i putted the last two holes and that's just very unusual for me no matter the round or the situation do some extra work on speed control here make sure i'm a little more dialed in but these greens seem to fit me better over the years than the ones in phoenix so again confidence boost but a bit disappointed coming off sunday,0
jordan spieth,0,2021-02,2021,409,1,0,1,my other question any enduring memory of playing junior golf with will zalatoris and how i'm assuming you expected him to reach this point and why what about him and his game do you think has allowed him to transition as well as he has,it's been it's definitely been a few years which is very weird because there wasn't a time period where i didn't believe in what i was working on prior to that from when i was so which has been tough right because you go out and put in all the hours but if you're not necessarily one fully trusting what you're doing and two it's maybe not the exactly what you need to be doing you're putting in hours going the wrong way so that's just extra time that it takes to once you're going the right way to be able to get things back to where you want so getting over kind of scar tissue of certain holes and rounds that you've played at different places where you just didn't have it that day versus being able to just draw back on positive memories for a number of years at places is something that is a new and different challenge over the last couple years but once you start to see light at the end of the tunnel get a little bit of confidence you just kind of want to stick with what you're doing and keep the train rolling and kind of reverse that trend so for me you know there was a number of things there was a number of things that i got off on mechanically and it was very frustrating because i felt just as competitive and felt just the same same i was still me still the same me i just would take the club back and feel lost so kind of feeling making some significant adjustments starting really last fall through this winter to kind of get back to my dna has been a process that has taken a lot of hours and still will now i'm able to try it out and trust it on the golf course and make the adjustments necessary because you can only on a driving range it's real easy to almost overdo things the direction you're trying to go to but on the golf course it's what level of trust will i have out here so fortunately i'm on the pga tour and i'm able to look back on swings that were made from good angles and trust that cameron's like okay i saw what you were doing here a little more of this a little less of that and we can move forward that direction,0
jordan spieth,0,2021-02,2021,307,1,0,1,on sunday you had said that you believe in what you're doing needle's pointed the right direction just curious when is the last time you felt like that and probably a dumb question but what are the specifics of what you're doing with your swing and i guess why does it feel different,no actually on i think it was like friday afternoon i was at under i was just in the top maybe like th or th and i was receiving texts that were like like it was my first pga tour event ever and as much as i enjoyed that support i was also like i mean i'm not leading by three i didn't win the golf tournament i'm yeah i know it's been a little while since i've been near the top but like come on guys i expect to be here you know and then after saturday's round after a low round like that it's you know those texts you'll get texts from friends or people that are like h that was awesome this or that which that was just the round specifically but no after sunday really after my putt missed on and i hit a great putt and just nothing went in that day i knew that i essentially couldn't win maybe i had to go eagle birdie so then it was let's go ahead and just finish strong so i was actually happy walking off the th green but at walking off the th green it was pretty deflating just being in the lead and having two holes to go and knowing that you essentially didn't have much of a chance to win the golf tournament that was frustrating and it's driving it makes me want to go out and work hard this week and try and get in the same position because i know that you put yourself in that position enough you start hitting the pins and they go in or the ball lips in on sunday and it goes your way so i didn't leave feeling like i won i actually left fortunately i felt disappointed that i didn't win,0
justin thomas,0,2024-02,2024,81,1,0,1,MODERATOR,yeah i feel like i'm playing well i feel like things are continuing to trend in the right direction back at a place i really enjoy and feel like i've had a couple chances to win in the past and haven't been able to i'm really hoping that this isn't a sign of things to come for the weather and the pga tour season how these last couple weeks have been it's always enjoyable here and i'm excited to get going,0
justin thomas,0,2024-02,2024,175,0,1,1,rory was talking last week about a phone call he had with jordan about a disagreement about the path forward with the strategic sports group deal now in place do you feel like the tour can go on its own now or do you still feel like there needs to be this coming together for the good of the game,i'm not necessarily super adamant one way or the other i want the best product and the best players i would say that there's a handful of players on liv that would make the tour a better place but i'm definitely not in the agreement that they should just be able to come back that easily i think there's a lot of us that made sacrifices and were very whether it's true to our word or what we believe in or just didn't make that decision and i totally understand that things are changing and things are getting better but it just would i would have a hard time with it and i think a lot of guys would have a hard time with it and i'm sure we don't need to convince you why we would have a hard time with it i think there's a scenario somewhere whatever it is down the road of some kind of version of some guys being back but when and what that is i have no idea,0
justin thomas,0,2024-02,2024,135,1,0,1,do you get the sense that strategic sports group is going to make significant changes to the pga tour or do you think it will look pretty similar at least initially,i'm not sure i really don't know like you said you don't get to be who they are and you also don't invest that much money for fun just because you love the game of golf clearly this is something that they view as an investment and to be able to have it grow which is exciting as a player but also as a fan of golf because for that to continue to grow and get better then our product is going to get better which is going to be more fan friendly to watch everything about it should continue to get better and more and more watchable and enjoyable and just people wanting to be fans of golf that part of it is exciting to me both as a player and as a fan,0
justin thomas,0,2024-01,2024,50,0,1,1,where i live in alabama people are excited you and nick dunlap in the final group talk about that because i know you haven't played with him right,i haven't played with nick no we've just been in touch and we text from time to time but he's in college so we don't run into each other too much i know coach seawell will be a very very happy man and a very anxious man tomorrow i'm sure,0
justin thomas,0,2023-12,2023,193,1,0,1,a lot of activity going on on the pif etc etc how much do you know and how much do you want to know,i think i'm in the middle of both i have so much respect for those guys on the board and the amount of time and effort that they have put in and the families for allowing it honestly not allowing it being good with it it's been frustrating on my end as a player and having someone on the board and the things that patrick cantlay said about them i understand patrick is who he is but he's beyond busted his ass to get the tour in the best place possible and for it to be with the rest of the guys on the pga tour board to make things the best possible place for us players going forward and i know all of them have done that i feel like when i know want to know something like all of everybody else i know that i can call any of those guys and they will tell me but naturally they are not no they don't reach out to people and say hey do you want to know what's going to be quite frank they are too busy to do something like that,0
justin thomas,0,2023-12,2023,112,1,0,1,sounds like you don't pick up the phone either and call and ask makes you wonder how much,i mean i have faith and i have trust i understand i get updated maybe from time to time but i am especially last year at the end i have bigger and better things to worry about to be selfish and honest my golf is i shouldn't say more important because the future of the pga tour is more important but selfishly for me my golf is and i know that those guys are willing to pick up the phone and talk to anybody if they want they just have to call them and i just haven't really had the desire to do that much i've got faith and trust in them,0
justin thomas,0,2023-10,2023,129,1,0,1,MODERATOR,i personally didn't think so i thought it was really great of zach and the pga to be accommodating to have us come over here and take a little scouting trip and i think that was obviously didn't show but felt it was very helpful it's a very very busy long week with very different routines and schedules that you would have in a normal week and this week the loss that we had this week has absolutely nothing to do with team camaraderie because this is probably the closest team i've ever been a part of we unfortunately just didn't play well enough kind of like max said earlier about sam i can't speak on behalf of everybody but i didn't feel the preparation was necessarily the issue,0
justin thomas,0,2023-10,2023,6,0,1,1,you said a little bit ago that this was the closest team you've ever been on curious now that this event is over is there some sort of example or moment this week that you guys pondered the most whether it was a laugh or a joke,living it up with the baby,0
justin thomas,0,2023-07,2023,70,0,1,1,how concerning is your current form,i played really well today it was very very tough out there i thought i i used today as a good opportunity to get ready for next week and i felt like i did that the golf in minnesota is obviously slightly different than here in liverpool but i'm hitting a lot of good shots i'm just making so many bonehead mistakes and crazy things happening and i'll be fine,0
justin thomas,0,2023-05,2023,10,1,0,1,can what happened at the pga championship last year translate to this year and second for the casual golf fan who might just watch majors what is the best way for a layman to understand the aimpoint,sorry the first question you said how can i translate,0
justin thomas,0,2023-04,2023,49,0,1,1,with the liv guys in the field this week seems like everyone is getting along and playing nice has it been awkward or business as usual,yeah i mean i haven't really talked to any of them i don't know if it's just been coincidence or i've just kind of had the blinders on i've just been business i'm not too worried about what they are doing and just trying to take care of myself,0
justin thomas,0,2023-03,2023,568,1,0,1,there was some significant news in the golf world yesterday with the usga and the r a's proposal just curious what your reaction was to it and how you think the pga tour should respond,yeah i think i was my reaction was disappointed and also not surprised to be honest i think the usga over the years has in my eyes it's harsh but made some pretty selfish decisions they definitely in my mind have done a lot of things that aren't for the betterment of the game although they claim it i had conversations with some usga members and it just to me i don't understand how it's growing the game for them to say in the same sentence that golf is in the best place it's ever been everything is great but and i'm like well there shouldn't be a but you're trying to create a solution for a problem that doesn't exist to me it's just it's so bad for the game of golf for an opportunity i mean some of the great things to me is the fact that you can play the exact same golf ball that i play i mean that's cool for an every day amateur golfer it's very unique that we are able to play the exact same equipment yeah i understand that i may have a different grind on a wedge whatever you want to call it but you can go to the pro shop and buy the same golf ball that i play or scottie scheffler plays or whatever but the usga wants to bring it to a point where that's not the case they want it to be okay well the pros play this way and the amateurs play this way and that just doesn't i don't understand how that's better for the game of golf the amount of time money that these manufacturers have spent trying to create the best product possible and now you're going to tell them and us that we have to start over for potentially if the pga tour pga of america don't adopt this local rule so for two of the four biggest events of the year we're going to have to use a different ball like try to explain to me how that's better for the game of golf and they're basing it off the top percent of all golfers you know what i mean i don't know how many of y'all consistently play golf in here but i promise none of you have come in from the golf course and said you know i'm hitting it so far and straight today that golf's just not even fun anymore like no that's not it's just not reality so i know i went on a rant a little bit but it irritates me because it's consistent with i feel like decisions and things that the usga has done in the past when it comes to rules or whatnot and data i mean what is it using mile an hour clubhead speed like if you can swing miles an hour like power to you i mean people are running faster so what are they just going to make the length of a mile longer so that the fastest mile time doesn't change or are they going to put the nba hoop at feet because people can jump higher now like no it's evolution we're athletes now like we're training to hit the ball further and faster and if you can do it so good for you so yeah as you can tell i'm clearly against it,0
justin thomas,0,2023-03,2023,96,1,0,1,as a follow up to that how much would it sort lift golf lift the pga tour to see rickie fowler back in the winner's circle,it would be great it's clearly trending that way he's playing some really good golf really solid consistent golf i can just tell from playing practice rounds with him or playing with him at home he's just he's a different person he's got a lot more swagger a lot more confidence his expectations are different it's funny just what a couple tournaments or maybe one particular shot or week here and there will do i think yeah he's definitely in that group of people that it's good for the game of golf when he's playing well,0
justin thomas,0,2023-03,2023,10,1,1,1,i'm just wondering about the liv and pga tour golf antitrust fight and wondering what it really means for the fate of pga tour players i know you talked about challenges here in terms of the wind conditions all of that stuff but is it something that pga tour players are thinking of in the back of their mind in terms of this antitrust fight playing out in the background while all these golf games are going on,no i'm not really wasting my time thinking about that,0
justin thomas,0,2023-03,2023,58,1,0,1,but in terms of what that fighting means for the fate of players because it will impact the pga's we have seen what's happened with say for instance in baseball or basketball where courts have sometimes changed the way a certain sports business works so in that sense do you pay attention to it and some of the legal issues because it just seems like it could impact the fate of players and the future of the players,i definitely don't doubt that it's a huge impact and it's very important but i'm not near smart enough to get involved in any of that that's not my job to get paid to do something like that i'm just trying to play golf the best i can and you know let the legal system go from there,0
justin thomas,0,2023-03,2023,344,1,0,1,can you talk about the new competitive model your thoughts about it and what the pga tour has done in the past year to make the players happier,yeah i guess players is kind of a relative term i think we definitely know one person that's not too thrilled about it but it's tough it's an extremely tough thing i think to kind of dive into i know max kind of did that whether it was last week or a couple weeks ago there's not going to be any model that makes everybody happy that's just a stone cold fact but at the end of the day when every single one of us signed up to play golf you knew that the better you played the better tournaments you were going to be into and the worse you played you may not even have a job anymore or you may be on a developmental tour or whatever it may be none of that is changing i just think there's it's a mindset kind of thing of the maybe some people that are upset about it is okay do i want to look at that table or look at that tournament and say that's not fair i don't get to play in that or do i want to say i want to be a part of that table or i want to be a part of that tournament that's how all of us were raised to think about golf is we want to play and practice and get to a point where we're playing in these majors and now playing in these elevated events against the best players in the world as often as possible and we're now developing have developed a model where that's happening i just i don't see how it wouldn't be better for everybody the fans the sponsors the communities the charities around there the players it's going to bring better out of us i just don't see how it's not better it's going to push all of us and then it's going to create more opportunities for guys to be a part of that and also kind of keep us competitive to want to stay in those events,0
justin thomas,0,2023-03,2023,253,1,0,1,after the third round of the pga last year i guess bones either gave you a pep talk or maybe it was tough love what have you i don't know how you would describe it maybe you could but why did that resonate so much and how much does he do that or is it important to pick your spots to do that,it's definitely important to pick your spots i think caddies have a very tough gig sometimes they're expected to say everything at the right times but the second that they say something at the wrong time a lot of guys are quick to get on them or maybe they will get on themselves it's really tough in that situation i think he just saw he saw me saw my body language he saw that i felt and looked defeated which i felt that way i felt like i just threw away a great opportunity to win a major championship i was pretty pissed off and i was pretty upset there's no reason why i wouldn't or shouldn't be i had been playing some really really good golf the last the previous couple months up to that and there was no reason to get myself in a head space to think anything differently it was just one round one bad day and in reality yeah it did look like i had shot myself out of it but there's nothing we could do and i just had to continue to stay positive and bones did a great job of reminding me of that we're still doing a lot of really good things we just had one bad day one fluky day and just go out and do the best we can tomorrow and see where it puts us he definitely you know talked me off the ledge a little bit because i was pretty bummed,0
justin thomas,0,2023-03,2023,159,1,1,1,when the tour announced the changes to the designated events last week greg norman tweeted i think it was imitation is the sincerest form of flattery in your mind what's the difference between the designated events and what liv is doing,smiling well we have an astronomically higher amount of quality players than they do in their events laughing but no it's very yeah it's extremely i think all of us have not been shy to say it that you know this is stuff that we've been trying to do and have worked on obviously got sped up a crazy amount due to what was going on in the outside but yeah i mean you could say it in different ways but it's no different than the wgcs were there's just obviously more than there were wgcs we still have your regular you know cut events i don't know i mean if you're just going to single out those events and have them only be the events we have then yeah it's extremely similar but there's a lot more going on over the course of an entire year on the pga tour than just the elevated events i would say,0
justin thomas,0,2023-01,2023,304,1,0,1,how difficult is that or maybe it's not difficult at all to not go to a place where you've shot and were many under for the week to say is it almost like oh i beat that course i don't need to go back,it could be i think at the end of the day a lot of events aren't going to change drastically they may lose one or two people here or there but i think it's going to be great opportunity for a lot of other story lines i think it's whether it's through a rotation of different events or guys winning for the first time and jump starting their career i mean it just i think these events that are non elevated are definitely understand that they're not elevated i understand that but they're still pga tour events they're still going to have same purses that they have now they're going to have opportunities for guys to play their way into augusta to play their way into the majors to play their way into the events whatever it is and it is unfortunate for both the events and the way they're perceived because they're still great events i hope that that's not the case that they get hurt too bad but at the end of the day the guys' schedules myself included i don't think are really going to change that much if torrey pines wasn't an elevated even and the purse was like jon rahm's probably going to go play there because he's probably going to finish in the top you know what i mean you look at a place like vegas and patrick cantlay like he plays really well there and if it's not an elevated event or whatever there's a good chance he's going to go play so at the end of the day we feel like or myself feel like i go to events where i feel like i have a chance to win and i think that's the majority of the guys out here their way of thinking about it,0
justin thomas,0,2023-01,2023,7,1,0,1,two questions going into the final round of the pga last year down six i don't know it was five shots what was the mindset going into that final round like did you think you could still win or i mean of course you want to have that thought of winning but what was that mindset,i didn't look at leaderboards on sunday,0
justin thomas,0,2022-12,2022,76,0,1,1,have you been able to play with tiger and charlie leading up to this how often do you play with them,we haven't all of us have our own lives going on i've been busy charlie has got school so and tiger is obviously hard on him about that and tiger has stuff going on and same with my dad we would love to get together and play more we asked if they wanted to play last week but charlie had midterms and that's way more important than this going on whenever we can we enjoy it,0
justin thomas,0,2022-12,2022,56,1,0,1,if you can think back you win the pga in becoming eligible for this tournament but at what point did it get on to your radar screen you didn't play until did you,no we didn't i don't know i think it truly was just kind of in conversation anything like that in we talked about it and tiger mentioned it and we're like why don't we go play in that we're like yeah that would be pretty cool now we've turned it into a pretty nice little tradition,0
justin thomas,0,2022-09,2022,101,1,0,1,justin what kind of excitement is there to play alongside your great friend jordan spieth and combined you get another point at the presidents cup for your team,yeah it's the best i think we were all talking about it last night and i know i talked to max about it a while it's just obviously if you could choose you know you'd rather win a major you'd rather win a pga tour event those mean and maybe do more for your career but these are just it's just more fun it truly is more fun winning points for your team getting to celebrate and kind of embrace the crowd you can't beat it once again you guys were able to save the hole coming out of the creek,0
jordan spieth,0,2022-09,2022,43,0,1,1,so jordan the streak is alive i'm not talking about you guys winning matches i'm talking about jordan's creek as named by justin yesterday,yeah it was the first time the ball's actually gone in the water though so let's make that clear and we've parred the other two times it's a tough hole so really that was just the first time we played the hole poorly,0
justin thomas,0,2022-09,2022,215,0,1,1,MODERATOR,yeah they're all different and i think they're all close in different ways you know some of it where it's all the significant others are maybe closer there's ones where it's kind of like it's all very close but it's almost in like groups of four or whatever it is but it's just all of us guys i think get along so well and i think what's most important is we really just respect each other's games i think max said it yesterday he's not necessarily extremely close with anybody i mean i would say that i'm good friends a lot of us are good friends with him or each other but it's not like we're you know we live in different areas we don't hang out that often but we all respect each other's games i think that's when we get in a situation and an atmosphere like this we have belief in one another and it's just like i said yesterday it's fun to be able to root for each other in terms of tomorrow yeah all of us are just going to keep our heads down and i mean i think we're going to be playing a little pissed off and try to go win points and see what we can do,0
justin thomas,0,2022-09,2022,168,0,1,1,billy congrats on the win just curious you wanted to be on one of these teams for a long time today was your first match did it live up to everything you thought it might be,i think we just keep doing what we're doing i think davis has done an unbelievable job of very very similar to strick at whistling straits last year he understands he has really really good players and he's taking information in that he needs and sees fit but he fully understands and thinks that we are capable of playing well enough on the course it's almost just kind of like a stay out of the way type thing this is when you're playing and just make sure you get to the tee on time kind of thing he's been great all the captains have been great in terms of what we can do we just have to keep playing golf we have to keep the pedal to the metal and try to get as many points as we can win each session and every single person on our team that goes out tries to win a point if we all do that then it will be good enough,0
justin thomas,0,2022-09,2022,69,1,0,1,no microphone,for sure i think the thing i like about it is it's bermuda you know just like the pga was so you know being back in obviously a familiar place and just a lot of great feelings a lot of great memories and i mean it's just an unbelievable golf course it's such a great test and i think it's going to be a really good venue this week,0
justin thomas,0,2022-09,2022,145,1,0,1,no microphone,i mean it's amazing they've done an unbelievable job and the pga tour set the course up this week that's one thing i learned this year about the presidents cup it's not the ryder cup where whoever is hosting is very heavily influencing what is going on the tour and quail hollow did an unbelievable job of just getting this place in unbelievable condition i really hope we can continue to get this sunshine and maybe a little bit of wind and dry it out a little bit just to get it firm and fast and really get you know challenging we don't want it to be stupid and make us look bad but at the same time it's match play and you're just worrying about the other team you're playing against if i win a hole with a double that's good enough for me,0
justin thomas,0,2022-09,2022,55,1,0,1,no microphone,the rough was very very long for the pga it's an awkward length right now but i mean it's bermuda the fairways are narrow it was pretty soft that week too like it is right now i mean the greens are pure so it's all very similar just the rough is quite a bit different,0
justin thomas,0,2022-09,2022,26,1,0,1,no microphone,it's very similar the rough is very very minimal compared to how it was for the pga being bermuda and soft it's a very similar setup,0
justin thomas,0,2022-09,2022,108,1,0,1,in terms of the overall chemistry can you tell that pretty quickly,for sure everybody gets along really well it's a young team we've played a lot against and with each other for a very long time so it's just you know i mean you think of a guy like max and you're like how has he not played on a team he's a five time winner on the pga tour billy horschel won a fedex cup won seven eight nine times he's an understanding believable player that's how deep the americans are in golf to have a team like this with great camaraderie and a lot of deep talent i think it's you know it's a lot of fun,0
justin thomas,0,2022-08,2022,182,1,0,1,how did the new putter feel today and why the change from the one you used at the pga,yeah it felt great it was the best i've putted in an extremely long time every single putt i hit was exactly where i wanted the speed i wanted it it was nice i hadn't felt that in a while i switched because it was the exact same feel scottie did an unbelievable job it's very difficult to make putters the exact same in terms of feel they may be the same but none of them are ever the same in terms of clubs in general but it feels identical so getting adjusted and acclimated to the speed wasn't difficult but just being a little bit shorter was so much easier for me to get in a good setup that's something we looked at earlier this year and we were going to mess with this off season but i haven't been putting great for how i feel like i should be and it was just one of those things i'm like if this is going to be an easy adjustment that's going to help me improve then why wouldn't i do it,0
justin thomas,0,2022-08,2022,167,1,0,1,you didn't get out here right away,i didn't and i think that was the best thing that happened to me is having to go through the process i did i had to earn it everyone knows when they sign up for professional golf what they're getting into they know you have to go earn what's yours and if you don't play well you're not going to get compensated that well you have to go through q school to get to at that time and now the korn ferry tour and you have to play well here on the korn ferry tour i would have loved to be out on the pga tour right away but i don't think maturity wise and probably everything else wise i was ready i probably could have kept my card and would have been okay but i don't know if i necessarily would have been the player i am today without going through more and learning about myself and just putting myself through the ringer kind of thing,0
justin thomas,0,2022-08,2022,134,1,0,1,just to piggy back i'm not sure how much you've thought about gaming this out but do you have any thoughts on what the solution could be i would think from a pga tour perspective they'd want to have the young exciting player out on tour as much as possible the opposite side of that would be you'd like a little bit of seasoning on the korn ferry tour to get ready as well do you have any thoughts on the solution,yeah i mean i've thought about it some i just think it's something where you can just get i don't know what the correct answer is or if it's just something like a small amount of guys that have the opportunity to come straight out here i think whether it's through a reshuffle through one year through two years through three reshuffles that's way beyond my pay grade of knowing how to handle things but i think some form of that of the top amateurs in the world or top college players in the world whatever it is to have the opportunity to at some point be able to play in these events in pga tour events i think some form of that is a good answer but how and when i don't know,0
justin thomas,0,2022-07,2022,70,0,1,1,justin liv i'm afraid how much are you talking about this and do you understand why we want to talk about it so much because we often get the impression that you feel you're fed up with us asking you about it do you understand why we want to know,i'm trying to not talk about it very much because i personally have had enough of it i would say but i very rarely am bringing anything up it's just more whoever brings it up to me i will discuss it as little as i have to but i have a lot bigger and better things to worry about than what's going on in another tour if that makes sense,0
justin thomas,0,2022-07,2022,119,1,0,1,MODERATOR,yeah the year is flying by again it's crazy how quickly it's just a couple events left before the playoffs so it was nice to win the pga for many reasons but first and foremost to knock a major off the belt but just get in a little better position going into the fedex in the playoffs so i don't feel like i have to press quite as much but been playing really well really solid definitely haven't converted as many into wins as i would like but still showing a lot of positive improvements and signs so i just feel like just trying to stay patient and keep plugging at it and hopefully let some good stuff happen,0
justin thomas,0,2022-07,2022,214,0,1,1,you've been very honest and open in anything you've said about liv golf over the last few weeks what are your thoughts on four liv golf players being in the field this week,i think yeah i think it's more stay loyal to the tradition that we are doing as opposed to against what they are doing not that we don't disagree but i just think it's and i'll be the first to say i've gotten wrapped up emotionally from time to time and i'm allowed to do that i'm passionate about it and i feel a certain way but at the end of the day myself and others first and foremost need to focus on playing good golf because that's the no priority but if we can continue to focus on improving our product getting our product as good as possible not only for now the rest of my career but future superstars that are going to be coming out because if we can make this continue to make this the best place to play bar none just as it is right now then at the end of the day we have nothing to worry about you never know what's going to happen in terms of other entities or other things being thrown out there but i think we're all very obviously pleased with where we are at and we are just continuing to make strides and progress and changes that are going to benefit everybody,0
justin thomas,0,2022-07,2022,413,1,0,1,going forward how important is it for the pga tour and the dp world tour that you rory collin morikawa and others stay loyal to the traditional tours against what's happening,a couple of them were i mean it sounds awful to say but i haven't had a good draw in an open so that definitely doesn't help but the last couple haven't been significant the first one i think with troon i've never in my life played like so well and grinded so hard to finish th i truly felt like i couldn't every morning i would go out and it would be blowing and raining and i would grind my tail off to go watch golf in the afternoon and the sun would come out and i was like well welcome to the open my first open championship that's just part of it i hope over a year year span of playing in this event i'm going to get my fair share of good ones but i think also it's adapting my game plan based on the weather conditions and a lot of people are going to have to deal with the same thing but i think i like i do in the states for the most part i go play no at augusta and it's going to be a driver or wood there's nothing else i'm not going to change anything whether it's raining or whatever wind off the left right down into my line might just change whereas i've gotten to some holes in the past i remember specifically like carnoustie the par is it hogan's hole or whatever that was the hole in the practise round i was like okay i'm going to hit driver i can hit it past these bunkers if i hit it right i'll be in the fescue and i'll lay up anyway but if i have an opportunity to knock it on this green this is a good chance or me to make a three or a four i got to that hole and it was like kind of raining off and it was off the left and same type of thing i kind of stuck with my game plan if you will and i decided to hit it driver and i hit it one of those little pot bunkers because i couldn't get over because it was raining i made whereas i should have the maturity and understanding of what's going on to hit a iron or iron and play the hole with what the conditions are giving you i've unfortunately learned the hard way but hopefully i'll adapt to that going forward,0
justin thomas,0,2022-07,2022,152,0,1,1,the liv guys have been kept apart from the rest of the golf the first two days but that probably won't be the case at the weekend how do you think it would go for you,four so i mean if i know all four of them then it will be fine it will be easy but if i don't it's not like i would talk to them whether they you know what i'm saying i think it would be one of those things it would probably be made a bigger situation than it is i don't necessarily think we're going to be having any like gamesmanship or needling each other out there at the end of the day they are here for the same reason we are and that's just trying to play well and give yourself an opportunity to win the scottish open yeah if it so happens that it comes to that point and you have an opportunity to you're trying to beat one of them to win the tournament it might be a little better but i'm sure they would say the same thing,0
justin thomas,0,2022-07,2022,223,1,1,1,you have been quite outspoken thus far have you had any pushback from any of liv guys about what you've said,i haven't personally done the math just because my interest level is not very high i think it's pretty obvious a part of it is it's one of those things i don't care to or want to because i know you can't compare those two situations they are very different but you know all i know is just i'm very fortunate to have a pretty cool little home office with some great trophies from the pga tour and i take great pride in those i'm very and i also understand that i'm not not everybody is in the same financial position that i am that i can sit up here and speak on behalf of everybody saying it's not about the money it's not about this and i've said that that people are allowed to do that just in terms of me or maybe other guys that are in my position i don't agree with that or i don't necessarily see how it could be a thing but yeah you have so many opportunities i mean more opportunities than i even know that i could end get up to continuing to do what i'm doing playing on tour we just hope to keep creating memories and legacy and history and produce some great golf tournaments like i'm sure we're going to this week,0
justin thomas,0,2022-07,2022,190,1,0,1,did you follow the results of the two events which have been held so far in london and in portland did you follow them,it's definitely getting up there and i think the partnership and now having so many pga tour guys here is cool and it's only adding to the strength of field if you throw out the majors i would have to think that this is going to be one of the two three four best fields that we play the entire year which you know for the scottish open for scotland for the dp world tour pga tour that's a huge deal and it should be everybody involved should be very proud of that and i know i'm happy and proud to be here and it's some very impressive and unbelievable players have not only played here but won this not necessarily here but this tournament so it is and this just kind of goes back to what we were saying it's adding your name to that list it's becoming a part of that history it's something that i definitely want to be a part of but i got you know of the top and plenty of other good ones to try to beat so it will be a fun week,0
justin thomas,0,2022-07,2022,339,1,0,1,obviously a lot of anticipation about tiger's appearance in st andrews next week you know him better than most what can you tell us about where he is now in terms of his game and what we should maybe expect from him next week or conversations you've even had with him,grow the game yeah i definitely i could chalk that up as things i never thought that i would do is play and be shown on nickelodeon playing on a golf tournament at years old but i'm glad i was it got great feedback from people it was freezing cold being covered in slime those l a nights it was really cool how good of a job they did with it just with the display of it and the graphics of it and everything and the creativity that they have and that's what it's all about it's an opportunity for us to reach out of this group right here you guys are going to see us play every week whether it's on golf channel sky sports cbs nbc whatever it is but to have the opportunity like you said for the six seven year old that's watching nickelodeon every night with their family their parents golf looks pretty fun pretty cool like maybe i want to get involved in that and if it means that ten kids from however many watched that show that night decide they want to start playing golf then i would call that a success i promise you if they had the opportunity to watch paw patrol or spongebob or the pga championship that night seven years old i'm probably not a good example i would choose the ga but any other kid would choose the show on nickelodeon so i think that's a great example of just like i said even if it's just a couple kids that have the opportunity to want to go play golf and then end up doing it and they say you know it's exactly like you said some kids like me grow up saying oh i want to win the pga some kids might say oh i want to play in the slime cup it's bizarre to even just say and hear come out of my own mouth but if that's what it takes that's what it takes,0
justin thomas,0,2022-07,2022,308,0,1,1,apologize from taking you away from slime cup to liv golf according to talor gooch the team element at liv golf must be similar to a ryder cup just wondering your experiences especially at whistling straits the way you got the fans fired up is he correct in saying that,for sure actually i joked i had this guy danny caddie for me the last couple days at the jp mcmanus pro am and he was the gm at old head which is an unbelievable course in ireland had a great time with him on sunday like i said we went and played tralee and got out there on monday and whatever hit my drive down the first hole and had like yards to like a pin in the centre of the green like downwind and iron like should be hitting this inside of ten feet all day and i hit it to feet and every single person clapped i just handed danny the club and i was just like well you know we're in the u k if we got a clap for all those shots we wouldn't be getting those claps if we were back in the states it's just stuff like that respect for the game of golf and how excited everybody gets we had a couple hundred people following us when jordan rick and i went and played tralee and it's like they yeah they maybe want to have the opportunity to get a picture or an autograph but they just want to watch us play golf they want to see the shots we hit they want to hear the sound that it makes the flight it has and it is and golf is unbelievable in the states as well i'm not saying it isn't but it's different like you said it just has so much history over here and it's definitely something i wish that i could i wish it was closer so that i could come over here more and spend some more time and play some different places because i've never had a bad time over here playing golf for sure,0
justin thomas,0,2022-06,2022,138,1,0,1,MODERATOR,yeah it's a great course i came on monday last week and it worked out well very similar to the pga where i was able to go kind of on the way to the venue for that week just wanted to come play because the practice rounds for the majors can be a little long a lot of guys haven't seen this place before so feel the need to play holes and check it out i just didn't really want to have a six hour practice round so it worked out well to come check it out it's a cool place it's very in front of you it's old school you've got doglegs i haven't been on the course since i was here monday but i'm sure it's going to be long rough and firm and fast greens,0
justin thomas,0,2022-06,2022,227,1,1,1,you alluded in a tweet yesterday to rory with that and it had a little smiley face whatever curious if you would talk about the situation in your sport right now and would you ever consider going to liv golf and if the answer is no would it be because of your loyalty to the pga tour or would it be because of going into business with someone like mohammad bin salman,yeah i was obviously very happy for rory and him winning the tournament i have a lot of respect for him not only as a golfer but just as a person i see how hard he works down in florida and it had been a little while since we've had that battle against each other on a sunday i definitely could have written the ending a little bit better if i could have come out on top it just was a big week for the tour i tossed and turned and lost a lot of sleep last week thinking about what could potentially happen and i grew up my entire life wanting to play the pga tour wanting to break records make history play presidents cups play ryder cups the fact that things like that could potentially get hurt because of some of the people that are leaving and if more go it's just sad it's really no other way to say it it just makes me sad because like i said i've grown up my entire life wanting to do that and i don't want to do anything else the people that have gone like i said they have the decision that they're entitled to make not necessarily that i agree with it one way or the other but everything has got a price i guess,0
justin thomas,0,2022-06,2022,65,0,1,1,phil mickelson to go to liv golf,i mean he was very adamant about it for a while so i don't think that decision or bryson really surprised any of us they were talking it up not only to a lot of their peers but other people i think phil going was not that surprising of a decision just based off of things that i was hearing internally from him and others,0
justin thomas,0,2022-06,2022,254,1,0,1,you and rory have sort of emerged as leaders in this whatever you want to call it the guys who are still deciding should i go should i stay are you making yourself available to them to talk to them or is this sort of everyone can make their own decision,i want it to be both we are all grown ups i go back and forth so much on different thoughts and how i feel about it i know what i want to happen but it's just at the end of the day you don't know if it is going to happen like i've said from the beginning it's astronomical money that they're throwing at people everybody has a price for everything it doesn't matter if you don't want to do it if you want to do it there's going to be some kind of number that's going to get people to think about it and they're reaching that number with a lot of people i just want to be able to basically say my part or what i think about the decision or the pga tour selfishly i don't want anybody to leave i've talked to some of my peers that have asked me questions and i don't know probably as much as others but i'm like you've got to do what's best for you or what you think is best for your career i'm like but selfishly i don't want you to go that's how i kind of end any phrase or any conversation that i'm having with somebody about it because at the end of the day i'm not their parent i'm not the person that's making their decisions all i can do is plead my case but everybody out here is a grown up they can make their own decisions,0
justin thomas,0,2022-06,2022,237,1,0,1,with rory it seems he's really taken a leadership role being pro pga tour are you surprised that he has taken that mantle and is he someone that a lot of guys on tour really look up to,i mean i would hope so just for the sake of i know he's accomplished a lot more than i have he's been out here longer he's been more successful but there's nobody that i think acts better for acts more humble and more grounded for what they've done and who they are than him i remember being a rookie and moving down to jupiter and he was out at bear's club being the person i am wanting to learn going up to him and saying hey i'd love to play sometime introduced myself and he's like any time and gave me his number and we kind of hit it off we're very similar personalities for me i definitely think that other people should look up to someone like him i do in some aspects there's definitely other parts that he's still a competitor and someone that i'm trying to beat but there's still a lot of things that as a leader that he does really well and i think that he's very honest like i am i'm not going to sit in here and feed a pc answer or just say something to maybe please a certain crowd if you feel a certain way you feel like you should say that that's what he does and he does it for the best reasons and hopes that it's going to be the best for the pga tour,0
justin thomas,0,2022-06,2022,2,0,1,1,how much with all the things that this press conference the one that phil mickelson was in obviously earlier is all the talk about liv series a lot of them probably not talking about the u s open how much of this becomes a distraction the fact that you have to answer questions,it is,0
justin thomas,0,2022-06,2022,207,1,1,1,with everything going on at the pga tour and liv tour what would be your message to young golfers who are dreaming of playing on the tour in the future,you know i think my dad said it best just was talking to him about not only everything going on with golf but just going on in the world i mean my dad is someone very old school just he loved to work he'd work hours a week as a club pro and he would pull the carts down in the morning close the shop up in the afternoon and he'd be the first to say he's like i made no money but i just love to work you have to love what you're saying is basically what i'm saying there's no amount of money that you could get that if you don't love or enjoy what you're actually doing the amount of money you have doesn't you're still going to be miserable you're still not going to enjoy it although you might be miserable in a bigger house or a nicer car that doesn't necessarily mean that your life is going to be any better i think it's what's very important for juniors and everybody growing up is you've got to be passionate about it and play for the right reasons and just want to get better and strive for that and keep working at it,0
justin thomas,0,2022-06,2022,194,0,1,1,you've got a lot of traction i guess when you talked last week about kind of separating the person from the decision of maybe someone going to liv why do you think that struck such a chord with people,because i think it's honest i'm guilty of it i've tried to get better but i just truly think it's just the day and age of i mean social media has just gotten that way to where it's like so negative anymore like i said i'm the first to admit that there's times where people do something and i bash them obviously not externally maybe internally with friends or whatever it is it's not necessary you can disagree with the decision you can maybe wish that they did something differently you can maybe another thing is being in the media as a writer you have to write about it i understand that but for people at home to necessarily say that dustin johnson is now a bad person that's not fair that's just not right now again i said it last week i'll say it again do i wish he wouldn't have done it and am i a little sad about it yeah but it is what it is you've just got to move on and make the best out of what you've got i guess just worry about yourself a little bit sometimes,0
justin thomas,0,2022-06,2022,104,1,1,1,at one point today i think there were seven players in the top in the world ranking in the top of the leaderboard it's moving a little bit what do you think that says about this tournament and specifically about the pga tour what it can deliver in terms of entertainment,yeah it's really cool obviously with everything going on this week was going to be very special regardless but i think it just i mean it makes i mean without sounding cheesy it makes me pretty happy inside seeing this there's no other place i would want to be playing and it's just obviously with a tournament like this and the history that it has and how long it's been played had a lot of great past champions and venues and drama and it looks like it has a potential tomorrow to produce a little bit more of that and create some more history,0
justin thomas,0,2022-06,2022,75,1,1,1,can i get your reaction to the pga tour suspending the players over in the liv now,i'm pleased i think anybody that's shocked clearly hasn't been listening to the message that jay and everybody's been putting out they took that risk going into it whether they thought it was a risk or not like i've said the whole time i have great belief and great confidence in the pga tour and where we're going and continuing to grow to and those guys just aren't going to be a part of it,0
justin thomas,0,2022-06,2022,166,1,0,1,MODERATOR,yeah it's getting there i obviously didn't have the week i wanted at colonial but i would like to think i had a couple factors in there that had to do with that poor play yeah i just took kind of four five days off i went home everything from the pga kind of hit me friday of the colonial and i just went straight to louisville and went and celebrated with my buddies some of my high school friends so that was fun to be able to do that and actually kind of enjoy that week took a couple more days off and then got back to it thursday so i feel like every day just getting a little bit better and more comfortable and the main hope and thought this week is to try to get my game prepared and ready for the u s open next week and if we can play well and have a chance to win then that's also great,0
justin thomas,0,2022-06,2022,197,1,0,1,MODERATOR,this is just a weird season for me in terms of scheduling i feel like for the most part i can tell you in december every event i'm going to play the entire year there's still events that i don't know if i'm going to play the rest of this year i truly went into i mean i would have loved to commit to this event earlier or what i was going to do but i truly was like i need to see how i feel the week of the pga to see if this is something that i want to do so obviously after playing well at the pga and feeling that it was a little bit potentially better or good preparation for me to play the week prior also geographically it's not like i think if this was here and maybe the u s open was at torrey pines i don't know that i would necessarily do it because it doesn't make sense logistically so being as close as it is and being in very similar conditions grass all that kind of stuff it just seemed like it was a great addition for the schedule,0
justin thomas,0,2022-06,2022,172,1,1,1,MODERATOR,yeah the pga tour has a lot of long standing great relationships with tournaments courses cities countries and it is cool i mean this is an event obviously along with many others that i've grown up and it just kind of stands the test of time or they're always on the schedule you know they are going to be and rbc has been a great sponsor and willing to do that for so long it's cool like you said you look at the history of this event it kind of speaks for itself the people that have been able to win this tournament i'm sure this has changed a lot of careers and lives for guys that have maybe won for the first time or done something in the season that's kind of meant a deal breaker for them but yeah the opportunity to come to a place and a tournament that's so historic just like a lot of events on the pga tour definitely makes it a little bit more special,0
justin thomas,0,2022-06,2022,166,1,0,1,your decision to play here was it solely because of the success you had playing the week before the pga championship or was there any thought to maybe making this week sort of stand out considering what's going on over in england,yeah i see him a good bit we don't play golf together at all i see him out at bear's club practicing and i mean he's really impressive i've always said that i mean i would think he'll do really well at a course like this he drives the ball on a string he's a great ball striker and he's obviously been a great ambassador and great for the game of golf in canada he just kind of goes under the radar he's such a nice dude and just i've played i think amateur and college golf against him so we've been playing against him with each other for a while but he's just someone i feel like that goes under the radar and just kind of goes about his business and doesn't necessarily do anything that's like crazy but it's just he's always going to be right there and he seems like a guy that could play out on tour for a very long time,0
justin thomas,0,2022-06,2022,305,1,1,1,nine of the top in the world are here this week including obviously yourself can you speak to the strength of the field the week before a u s open guys who are near the top of their games looking to prepare nicely for next week at the u s open,yeah you know it's a bummer i mean i think a lot of us are i don't know if annoyed or tired is the right way i mean it's just one of those things i mean i've thought a lot about it and it's like look like people are entitled to choose as they wish i don't dislike d j now i don't think he's a bad dude i'm not going to treat him any differently it's like he's entitled to choose as he wishes and i think that the day and age that we live in now it's just so negative that you see it in everything sport politics whatever it is it's like if you disagree with someone you just feel that you're entitled to like hate them and talk bad about them and just bash their decision when everybody's entitled to their own opinion you know what i mean like i said it doesn't make him a bad person now i'm disappointed and i wish that he and others wouldn't have done it but that's their decision i've said it all along it's like guys can do as they wish if they want to go they can go if they want to stay they can stay selfishly i think and i know that the pga tour is the best place to play in the world and it's just the decision is theirs and it is what it is but i just i wish that it would take away or i wish it wouldn't be taking away from the great story lines and things that are going on on a tour that's been around for a very long time and is in one of the best places it's ever been it's just a bummer that those guys won't be a part of it,0
justin thomas,0,2022-06,2022,132,0,1,1,can you give us your thoughts on what's going on with the liv league and players who are now being announced to go over as well,i think it's very similar to the northeast and the states it's passionate sports fans obviously you have the nhl that's so prevalent up here and just there's such a difference of an obnoxious sports fan and a passionate sports fan i think a lot of the fans that are going to be out here just are very gracious and happy that this event is going on i mean obviously not having it for a couple years they're going to be excited they're going to be ready and they deserve that everybody in canada and toronto deserves this so i'm excited to be here and a part of it and i'm sure playing with rory and corey we're going to have some pretty nice crowds out there so it will be cool,0
justin thomas,0,2022-05,2022,103,1,0,1,can you compare and contrast the first pga championship victory to the second one,i can't i just said that outside to rex i haven't had a chance to watch like the full coverage on sunday which i'd like to but i did happen to see when i was putting on nine i was eight back i was eight back with holes to go that's unfathomable if i was looking at leaderboards i probably would not have thought i even had a chance to win it's a huge learning lesson for me you've got to play golf those majors and in golf tournaments anything can happen i just kind of kept plugging along and somehow it happened,0
justin thomas,0,2022-05,2022,75,1,0,1,two time pga champion sounds pretty good what are your emotions,you know it hasn't sunk in just yet i think it did more in the moment i was jittery and i almost kind of couldn't feel my limbs walking up to that tap in although trying to two putt from feet or whatever it was is usually pretty doable but downhill when you know you've got a two putter to win i was very pleased to see it end up that close to the hole,0
justin thomas,0,2022-05,2022,93,1,0,1,take us back to the playoff the th hole your tee shot where does that rank in terms of your nerves what you were feeling and how you executed that shot,that was a nice one i mean the wind off the left with a wood isn't exactly my favorite so i hit a beautiful shot in regulation in that bunker like we wanted to and i just i hit essentially the same shot just had a little bit more cut on it and for it to go up on the green was nice just to put a little bit of heat on will but i like these th holes in the pga championship so i'd like to keep making a habit of that,0
justin thomas,0,2022-05,2022,94,1,0,1,can you speak to how special it is to win the pga of america's major championship considering your father and your grandfather,yeah it's very very special i'm pleased at this point any of them is great i don't care which one it is as tom brady always says your favorite super bowl is your next one and that's what my favorite major is and at this moment it's definitely this guy right here yeah i'm looking forward to talking to my grandma i'm sure she was watching i know somewhere up there grandpa was definitely watching today and pulling for me it's very very cool to be able to share this moment with my family,0
justin thomas,0,2022-05,2022,78,1,0,1,i was going to say we know how much you love to needle your friends out here on tour you just joined rory with two pga championships how much are you looking forward to trash talking with some of your buddies out here after this and also with tiger and charlie as well,i mean this is a good moment where the trophy can speak for itself i don't need to necessarily bring it up on my own i'm very fortunate right now that although there might be people ranked higher than me in the world ranking but at least in my eyes i'm on top of the golfing world right now and i'm very very proud of that i think i'll let the trophy and the week speak for itself,0
justin thomas,0,2022-05,2022,139,0,1,1,can you describe what it feels like to sort of live the childhood dream of this is a huge pressure moment i have to hit this shot like in the playoff that's really hard you did it and executed it what does that feel like to you,it's just awesome i don't know really how else to describe it other than that i mean that iron shot on in regulation like that's why i play golf like that's why i practice all the hours and everything and the time put in you want to be in that scenario you want to be in that situation with the backdrop of the whole gallery up there knowing that i'm in contention i have a decent chance to win this tournament probably one of the hardest if not the hardest hole on the course and i hit a great drive down there and to be able to just flag an iron like that when i know in my head i needed to make birdie it's awesome it's hard to explain but it's a full body chills type of feeling,0
justin thomas,0,2022-05,2022,12,1,0,1,with the pga not being here since the course has probably changed a ton since it was here last year but with the senior here last may did you reach out to anybody to ask for advice with it being your first time playing here,i didn't i probably should have done that no i did not,0
justin thomas,0,2022-05,2022,68,1,0,1,obviously surreal to have a major championship without the defending champion here do you have sympathy for him or do you feel like he's a big boy and he's made his own bed,i don't really have an opinion i never wish bad on anybody it's just i'm here to try to win a golf tournament and try to win the pga championship i think it's going to be an unbelievable venue and a great week regardless yeah it's obviously about reform but i don't feel very strongly one way or the other i'm just here to take care of business,0
justin thomas,0,2022-05,2022,142,1,0,1,secondly what do you envisage the end game or best possible outcome of this saudi situation being rory said a couple months ago it was dead in the water and he's now admitted to maybe jump the gun on that but it's clear greg norman isn't going to go away quietly,i don't know i'm very content with the direction the pga tour is going and i think it's just continue to go get better and better very quickly too i think a lot of players feel the same way which is very important we have a lot of loyalty to the tour they have done a lot for us that's the thing yeah we have all said things can be better but same thing as if you went and played that like you want things better anyway like why wouldn't we all want things better than we have it so i mean i'm not sure what the end game is going to be and i think a lot of people very similar to myself are just kind of ready for it to happen or not and us stop answering questions about it,0
justin thomas,0,2022-05,2022,171,1,0,1,i know when guys turn up to a new course on the pga tour they have all this shotlink data to look at and some guys look at packets and the scoring average do you look at those and this week when you don't have the luxury of that how do you learn this golf course in two days three days,i don't i think trying to say it as politely as i can it's pretty obvious i've looked at stuff before and it's like you get to go look at riviera is a hard hole like no kidding like it's a tough hole i didn't need a piece of paper to tell me it's a tough hole it's one of those things comfortability is more important than anything and if you get a situation like at riviera where the percentage play is to go for it but for me it's not i mean i play that hole under basically every single year laying up and it's just a better fit for me i think you just play the golf course and make of it what you can that was huge for me coming monday last week because those practice rounds can be long and grueling to make this week a little shorter and easier i knew what i needed to practice the next two days it just makes the prepare easier,0
justin thomas,0,2022-05,2022,81,1,0,1,the bumpy first nine on thursday and then you turned the corner what do you think changed this that stretch,yeah i would say bumpy is an understatement it was just flat out bad i drove it very poorly on thursday and i don't know i just i think after three weeks off i was just a little rusty i think i had a hard time kind of getting back into it which is why i'm here i'm here to kind of knock off some rust and get my game trending in the right direction going into the pga next week,0
justin thomas,0,2022-05,2022,118,0,1,1,how is heat a factor,well i live in florida so this isn't i mean this is hot but it's not everybody when i first came here they're like oh sorry about the heat and i'm like you're fine this is nothing so i would like to think and hope that it plays to my advantage i take my conditioning and my training very seriously to where i can get in shape for times like this to where my energy level stays high and i continue to play at a high level throughout the course of the week so maybe tomorrow come the back nine i'll still have that same energy same fight and adrenaline and try to go win a golf tournament,0
justin thomas,0,2022-05,2022,154,1,0,1,in the calendar was different when you won it the pga championship was at a different time we've settled back into normal life let's hope next week last year when we played the pga championship you missed the cut if i'm not mistaken does it mess have you guys kind of gotten into the groove of the major schedule the way it is now and if so what do you think about it,i mean monday was the first time i've ever been there i really really liked it i mean i was blown away with just how i thought how good of a golf course it was i thought tee to green it was excellent i thought it challenged kind of all facets of your game you have to work the ball quite a bit you have to you really really have to be good around the greens you can't fake your way around it and it's tough to chip i mean the balls roll off the green they go pretty far away you get some grainy elevated greens to where it's difficult to get the ball around the hole and over the course of the round in a tournament that can be quite a few shots and the person i think that does that the best is going to have the best chance of winning,0
justin thomas,0,2022-05,2022,316,1,0,1,do you recall when that might have been,i mean i would hope it would deter them from going over there i mean i think jay's made it very clear from the start of what would happen or you know i think a lot of people are probably like i can't believe you did this or wow you went through with it but i mean this is what he said was going to happen all along and yeah it's one of those things to where he just doesn't want the competing tour the back and forth you know it's like look if you want to go go i mean there's been plenty of guys that have been advocates of it and have just talked it up all the time and they have been guys behind the scenes that are saying i'm going i'm doing this and like my whole thing is like just go then like stop going back and forth or like you say you're going to do this it's like you can do everybody's entitled to do what they want you know what i mean like if i wanted to go play that tour i could go play that tour but i'm loyal to the pga tour and i've said that and i think there's a lot of opportunity for me to i mean break records make history do a lot of things on the pga tour i want to do and there could be people that want to make that change and it's like you're allowed to have that decision you're a human being and that's just a part of it so i mean i don't think it was i mean maybe i'm sure there's a little bit of surprise like oh wow like yeah he really did it that kind of thing but yeah it was nothing off the beaten path that jay didn't say he was going to do,0
justin thomas,0,2022-05,2022,251,1,0,1,what was your reaction last night to the pga tour not granting releases and do you think it will detour guys from going over there,the rough's definitely spotty i think it's very at least for a monday at southern hills it's similar to where it's kind of flier city you get it it's not when you get that really long bermuda you know it's going to come out thick and likely going to just kind of be more of a pitch out kind of thing but when you get this kind of rough it's really judging how far the ball's going to fly as well as you can and yeah i mean i wouldn't the fairways are big i mean you have a pretty good amount of room but i've definitely played wider fairways like caves valley last year the fairways were just massive it's not like to that extent but yeah when you get some wind and it seems like there's going to be a fair amount of crosswinds just by i could be wrong but at least off of some of the practice i've had the last couple days so that shrinks the fairways quite a bit yeah at the end of the day you're still it still is important to hit the fairway and you still have to go execute the shot it's just more of maybe that one that was feet offline at another course that could have found a hazard or under a tree could maybe just catch the edge of the fairway or the rough and then you're just going to have to kind of go forward from there,0
justin thomas,0,2022-04,2022,68,1,0,1,you're a major champion can you speak to winning your first major and the feelings that come with it,his world is changing the masters is different than the pga championship they're both great and they both change your life but nothing changes your life like a masters i'm sure so he is never going to be able to do the same stuff again in a good light and good reasoning but yeah it's deserving he has earned everything he has done the last couple of months,0
justin thomas,0,2022-04,2022,81,1,0,1,you played with some big leads what's the mentality of trying to finish something off,it's hard probably the most nervous nights i've had and the most nervous rounds i've had are on leads still to this day teeing off sony in ' was one of the hardest all i kept hearing was no one's ever blown a seven shot lead on the pga tour it seems like that's what every media question led with so it was tough but i mean seven shots is a lot of shots so it is one of those things,0
justin thomas,0,2022-04,2022,177,1,0,1,you've been such a consistent force on the pga tour top s and wins but in the majors since it hasn't been quite as fruitful do you feel like you've underachieved quite a bit in the majors,i know i have i have not even close to performed well in my entire career in majors i had a good year in ' i had one good major there at the pga i think in ' and played well at the masters here in ' but in terms of a result standpoint which is at the end of the day is all that matters when it comes to tournaments is how you finish at the end of the week but no i feel like i've performed very very poorly i feel like i've learned but i've just put too much pressure on myself in the past and maybe put the tournament on too much of a pedestal and tried to you know just overdo things when in reality i should have faith in my game and the things that i can do on the course with the golf ball whatever it is i just need to get a little bit better at kind of getting in my own world and just going to play golf,0
justin thomas,0,2022-04,2022,164,1,0,1,were you doing things differently for majors than for other tournaments,yeah as i think everyone else does it's weird it doesn't make sense why would i try any harder for this event than i did for kapalua or anything else but at the end of the day everyone does you want to be peaking for before it was four times a year now it's five times a year looking at the fedexcup as well that's the goal you want to be playing well but not the best that you can and then once you get into april you want to peak some and not necessarily plateau or go down but kind of maintain it a little bit and go up a little bit more as you get to the pga so just kind of keep finding what works for you and everyone's different i clearly still haven't found what my answer is but obviously i'm getting very very close at the end of the day i just play better golf and it's all good,0
justin thomas,0,2022-04,2022,232,0,1,1,justin do you have a theory on why the greens at augusta national have confounded you so much,you know it's just so situational on where you are on the greens i putt unbelievably i read the greens really well i putt unbelievably when i come here in any other round just fun rounds and play i think because it's a lot easier to get the ball where you want it's a lot easier to leave the ball underneath the hole because the ball doesn't have that extra roll out or doesn't take that bounce that maybe goes just above the hole on say a hole like it's if you get a middle pin or just to make it easy it's a lot easier to put a wedge that's right and under the hole to have an easier putt versus that one that takes a skip past and now all of a sudden i have an eight footer that breaks three feet a lot of it is just very situational and where i'm leaving it i definitely feel like i've putted a lot better than the stats would show something like that out here just in holing putts but i know what they're doing it's just a matter of matching the speed and everything like that up consistently but that's why i've been working very hard on big breaks and matching up my speed and being able to deliver it how i want to so i'm more prepared this year,0
justin thomas,0,2022-04,2022,153,0,1,1,why do you think jordan putts so well out here,because he's got the best speed of putter i think i've ever seen you look at all his putts especially all of his midrange putts every single one of them goes in with the exact same speed they don't hit the back of the hole they're probably going to go anywhere from to inches past the hole i don't think people realize how hard that is and how good that is to consistently do that every single time i feel like you very rarely see him hit a putt that's going to go four or five six feet past and hits the back of the hole and pops up and goes in that happens often to other people but he just has such a creative and great feel great hands and feel that he can kind of deliver what he wants with his putts and the hole gets in the way pretty often,0
justin thomas,0,2022-04,2022,178,1,0,1,justin you said you felt you maybe put the masters on too much of a pedestal is it different than what you felt about the pga championship compared to what it's meant to your family,yeah i think i just did it with masters in general the players isn't a major but it's kind of being talked up for us to be on that same level but with it being moved this was always in the you know the first major of the year the first so it was easier to kind of get hyped up a little bit more for that first one if that makes sense i don't know if that changes anything but all majors are obviously important everybody's going to want to win a certain one more than others yeah i just think it's one of those things you have to take the tournament for what it is because if you make the situation bigger than it already is it's going to be a lot harder i know in the pga in ' it obviously was very important and a huge moment for me but i just felt very calm and i didn't make the moment bigger than it was that's something that i was able to learn from,0
justin thomas,0,2022-03,2022,90,1,0,1,no microphone,audio cut out putt looking at the hole or a very situational type thing the only person i've ever physically played with is jordan and he only did that on short putts i've never played with somebody on the pga tour that's done it so i think it gets it's tough i understand what you're saying and i think a lot of it goes into the freedom you're not looking you're looking and reacting at things so i definitely understand the concept but i definitely would be curious on that,0
justin thomas,0,2022-03,2022,52,0,1,1,what did you do during all the downtime while you were waiting to try and get that first round completed you posted a picture of yourself and your dog,not much we have some good friends that live like minutes away so we're staying in their house the spieths are there with us so we've just been hanging out i will say that a dog and a baby keeps the downtime occupies it a lot easier for the both of us,0
justin thomas,0,2022-03,2022,179,1,1,1,obviously we've seen a lot of athletes in sports all across have their pr blunders their missteps what have you obviously phil has been in the news for the last two weeks how long do you feel like phil is going to be in a sort of penalty box or put himself in this self imposed exile and how long before you think he gets back in golf's good graces,it did a lot and it's so true obviously you're a defending champion but i don't have to defend anything i'm not defending this title the pga tour isn't going to come to my living room and take my players championship trophy from from me after this week that's mine forever i don't have to give anything back and my name's always going to be on that trophy i'm just going to go try to win it again that's all i'm going to try to do it was very i was glad to hear him say that but it was also funny to see the coach that i love to watch give interviews almost come out when they're like coach you've defended a lot of titles and national championships what do you think this is going to be like for justin you could just see his hands getting into it like he's not defending anything kind of thing it was funny to watch but i am very glad that he said that because it definitely resonated well with me,0
justin thomas,0,2022-03,2022,173,0,1,1,if you look back to your first time and compare it now what is the one most striking thing that has changed about this place in the time you've been coming here,yeah the honda is an event clearly i would love to play i live there it's a place i've had success at but i've said it a million times it's just we have to take off somewhere i just spent four weeks on the west coast it wouldn't have been a very smart decision for me to play the honda with the amount of travel and just mentally physically because for me i don't want to shoot myself out of the year in february i feel like there's so many great tournaments in golf left throughout the rest of the year that i don't want to put myself behind the ball so early in the year yeah it's just one of those things it just doesn't fall in a great place in the schedule but it was also nice to take two weeks off i'm going to play three weeks in a row starting here and then i'll have a week off before augusta and hilton head so i'm excited for this stretch,0
justin thomas,0,2022-03,2022,110,1,0,1,talk about the decision behind taking the two weeks off coming into this i know you haven't played those two tournaments in a while but is it kind of a good time to reset with everything coming up with this and the masters and everything,whew i would say the pga at valhalla was the first i can really remember i know i watched his tournaments before that but nothing like specific or vivid memory like being at valhalla when he won the pga i would say that's what i first remember what he's done for the game since then is just monumental i don't think i could even come close to putting it into words he's been a massive impact and influence on me and i'm very happy that i got an afternoon tee time on thursday so i can go watch him get inducted that's going to be pretty cool a special night,0
justin thomas,0,2022-03,2022,157,1,0,1,sawgrass this course,yeah it's definitely a goal it makes more sense for guys in the u s to do it on a ryder cup year just for the sake of being able to count the event we're so fortunate to have so many great events on the pga tour but also so many great events on that tour that i would love to play both but just again if i'm skipping an event that's minutes from my house it probably doesn't make a lot of sense to fly across the world for some other events but no it would be a massive accomplishment of mine and it's something that i do take seriously and would love to do at some point at the end of the day it's going to be one of those things where if it makes sense and i'm playing well in the correct events kind of thing and hopefully we can do it one year,0
justin thomas,0,2022-03,2022,98,1,0,1,the pga tour hasn't at least made any statement about the russia ukraine issues and yet there are sponsors that sponsor events on the pga tour that are still operating on ukraine actually what's on your sleeve that bank is operating in ukraine as well do you have any thoughts on that and have you talked to the tour about making some kind of statement,yeah i'd say because it's one of the deepest fields in golf and it's really hard to win golf tournaments the fact of the matter it's really hard to win a golf tournament once and it's really hard to win it again obviously a lot of expectations and pressure come with it but i think first and foremost it's look how deep this field is it's just really hard to win a golf tournament when you have top most of the top players in the world i would say that's first and foremost the biggest part of it,0
justin thomas,0,2022-01,2022,112,0,1,1,on both tour stops in hawaii now i suppose,yeah yeah i was trying to do it again today but no it yeah i mean it's a huge i mean it's fun every golf course you go to i mean there's a scorecard in the locker room i mean it's pretty fun having a handful of buddies that live in chicago that will go play medinah every once in a while and they will send me pictures of my scorecard it's stuff like that whether the people know me or not or whether they know whoever shot the course record or not it seems like that's kind of a part of the club at that time so it definitely means something,0
justin thomas,0,2022-01,2022,102,1,0,1,did you see the news about the women's purse going to million dollars,it's unbelievable it's awesome i mean there's so much obviously that goes into purses and i mean being involved in some more stuff with the pga tour you always just think i should get more money i should do this but these are businesses the lpga is a business the pga tour's a business and they have to run appropriately and it's awesome to see the usga step up because those women are playing at the top of the top level and in a major championship like a u s women's open it's a great step in the right direction for sure,0
justin thomas,0,2022-01,2022,205,1,0,1,no microphone,i think there's times when we're definitely more than others but it's more for me it's just more my goal is to win and do as many great things in the history of the game on the pga tour and there's definitely i mean a huge huge career goal of mine is to win both tours the fedexcup and the race to dubai in the same season that's a huge dp world i'm sorry yeah sorry about that but that's a huge goal and would be a tremendous accomplishment to me so it's something that's important but at the same time we just don't have any time off to do that i think if we had the opportunity to maybe have some time off in the fall to where we could go play in some of the dp world events to build a little bit of a bankroll on that money list and then have the majors wgcs to where it could be worth your while but i mean to me obviously what's most important is playing well on the pga tour but there's definitely a point where i would love to be able to compete on both tours and not feel like i'm gassed,0
justin thomas,0,2021-09,2021,202,0,1,1,MODERATOR,probably i mean i knew it was going to be a special week and we were all going to be together as a team but just the brotherhood the camaraderie i mean the moments in time spent in that team room it's hard to explain even though it's like last night just getting together you'd think that all of us are best friends the entire year we hang out we all live in the same place and it's just a lot of fun it's great for all the girlfriends and wives to catch up and it's great for all the players especially with tour championship being a couple weeks ago being able to catch up from what they've been doing the last couple weeks what they've been up to i don't know i mean france was obviously the outcome was not anything like we wanted but i'm sure everybody even the guys that had been there i mean it's just like we play a stroke play tournament you hope to learn from any experience you have and i feel like i tried to learn from how to handle my emotions and adrenaline and everything like that that'll hopefully be helpful this week,0
justin thomas,0,2021-09,2021,183,1,0,1,the ryder cup could have likely been played last year but that would have meant without fans what does it mean to have the fans here this week and what role do they play in this event,they play a huge role like i said i haven't experienced one on u s soil but i'm very excited to i think all of us partook in a little bit of a i guess a poll last year on how we would want if the ryder cup was to happen how we would want it would we rather play it with no fans would we rather play it with half fans or just cancel it my number one answer was play it with full fans or nothing else it's a huge advantage to play in front of your home crowd and it's also what makes the event so special it would have been a shame to play this without fans or even with very very limited fans this is one of the biggest sporting events in the world and it's a huge deal for the pga it's a big deal for us i think they did the right thing in pushing it back a year to make sure that not only us players but everybody could experience this for what it's worth,0
justin thomas,0,2021-08,2021,244,1,0,1,staying on that point what do you think about the staggered scoring system,i like it more now than i feel like i did when i first heard it it's tough i mean it's easier for people to understand at home which i think was the main reason that it's happened or that it kind of came about and having the opportunity to have a different tour championship winner than fedexcup i'm not really a big fan of whoever finishes lowest wings the golf tournament because that's not necessarily the fact and winning golf tournaments out here is a big deal so i personally wish that that wasn't a thing because i mean you know obviously if you're under you have a lot better chance to win the actual tournament versus everyone starting at the same score and then you obviously get into the fact of i could have the greatest season of all time on the pga tour i could win times in a season and i could come here and i could just have something just detrimental happen to where i either can't play or i have an injury and i don't play then i finish th in the fedexcup because of that and i don't think that's fair i think that's something that could somehow be tweaked or fixed but i do like the fact that everybody that's here this week knows exactly where they stand and they know what they have to do and they just have to go out and get it,0
justin thomas,0,2021-07,2021,125,1,0,1,we spoke to you earlier in the week and you said about your excitement about being here tell us what it's like to be part of a rolex series event with a great field and people out there that applaud and they understand the rules of golf,yeah it's great i've had great experiences playing in europe and it's makes me feel at home for some reason i don't know what it is i think a lot of guys on the pga tour come over and play here we get a great welcoming which is cool makes me want to come back and makes a lot of guys want to come back for someone like myself i look at it as an opportunity to play in front of them i don't get to play in front of these fans very often unless they are travelling a long way to come watch a tournament it was good to put on a little bit of good golf and give it a run somewhat today,0
justin thomas,0,2021-07,2021,65,1,0,1,how do you do that obviously the greens are quicker on the pga tour how do you come over here and adapt,well it's the same of any week you have three days to adapt and get used to it i hit a lot of putts a lot of lag putts and just spent a lot of time trying to get used to it everybody else has to deal with the same thing and that's really just what i've tried to use monday tuesday and wednesday for,0
justin thomas,0,2021-07,2021,83,1,0,1,your thoughts on the course and being here at the abrdn scottish open,course is great course is a little bit firmer got quite a bit of rain the last two days and was even beautiful today saw my shadow today which is something i don't know that i've seen in scotland before that was nice it's an enjoyable week the european tour always does an unbelievable job of treating myself and all of us from the pga tour that come over here make us feel like rock stars so it's a very very enjoyable week,0
justin thomas,0,2021-07,2021,70,1,0,1,i just wonder if it feels a bit different in terms of this whole process of acclimatising yourself to british seaside golf because obviously there wasn't an open championship last year you weren't able to travel and there has been that sort of two year gap is it a more demanding process this time around,well yeah it's definitely different than it was two years ago but it's not that different than what we have in place in the pga tour i mean it's a little bit different but you still have to go through testing and allowed certain places not allowed others whatever it might be yeah i don't think you can quite compare what the experience was like two years ago versus now,0
justin thomas,0,2021-06,2021,356,1,0,1,MODERATOR,yeah i was a little irritated that it got out i didn't really want it to that wasn't the intention of it i just i saw the video of mike talking to calling his dad after he mondayed in valspar and in a day and age where it seems like only anything in the media is negative and not good these days i just felt it was so refreshing and great to see and how genuine his excitement and emotions were i mean i don't know mike i didn't know him i met him at valspar i just went up and said congrats on getting in it's a great story and play well this week but i just thought it was awesome because he's been playing the mini tours and been successful on the mini tours for a long time and people now knew who he was because of his story i don't know it just for some reason it hit home to me and it just was like man you know this is a dude who's been grinding for a long time and there's a lot of people not just him that are doing that but i just wanted to help in a little way and what i'm most happy about is the recognition he has got and i heard that someone on the board of i don't know if it's true or not on the board of charles schwab heard about what i did and then wanted to sponsor him and take care of him and his expenses and everything throughout the rest of the year or however long it is and that's what i'm most happy about the fact that he is able to now take advantage of more opportunities because of just something little that i did and again it wasn't the intention for it to get the publicity it did i just wanted it to be direct between him and i but if it helps him get more notoriety and helps him and others you know able to pursue this dream of playing on the pga tour then so be it,0
justin thomas,0,2021-06,2021,333,0,1,1,secondly mike davis's career at the usga's coming to an end and his time as ceo and at the usga sort of not totally but coincides a bit with your career just wonder if you had thoughts on his contributions to usga to setups at u s opens and what you thought of his work,i think it was the gesture because he didn't even look at it and it's it wasn't anything not anything crazy i mean it was just i just wanted to help you know i don't care if it's a thousand dollars like that's extremely helpful for someone who is in that position and that's what i wanted to do i wanted to be just like hey man i know q school's expensive i know playing in these events are expensive and like any little way i can help out i want to and i want to be helpful more than just money i want him to be able to i mean i told him i'm like dude any time you he lives in florida and we were going to play some golf together but i just was like hey dude if you ever want advice if you ever want to pick my brain you ever just want to talk like i'm here for you i'm happy to help i was very fortunate to have some great mentors and people willing to help me growing up and if it's a difference of him playing on mini tours or getting his korn ferry card the next year then like that's that means more to me than any amount of money i could ever give him or anybody so it was it just was great because again i haven't been in a great place both just mentally and on the golf course and for me it was great because it just i felt joy out of seeing his joy and it just kind of totally made me forget about what's going on in my golfing life and sometimes puts things in perspective that obviously we're all out here to play golf and we're all out here to try to win a lot of golf tournaments but changing people's lives and helping people who are less fortunate than you is sometimes you know more important than that,0
justin thomas,0,2021-06,2021,314,1,0,1,you had a little social media banter with phil after he won the pga i'm just curious what were you most impressed with about the way he won and just maybe speak to how he did that with really not showing a whole lot of form for awhile,yeah it is such a brutal day it's so hard it's so much golf in one day and often in this time of year you're probably going to get a little bit of weather at some point and potentially get some storms where you have to come back the following day or whatever it might be but i had been close a couple times where i had had a good first round or at least had been right there to where i'm one round away from getting in the u s open and you know when you've never played in one that's a huge deal it's such a different kind of nerves than trying to win a golf tournament or it's just like trying to make the cut sometimes or like when you're around the cut line those last couple holes are sometimes more nerve wracking than trying to win a tournament i don't know it's weird it's hard to explain but it's very similar in the fact that it's a little bit of an out of body experience and you kind of get out of the idea of i'm just trying to make birdie on this hole to like all right i'm just trying to stay ahead of the number to get in whereas if you just tried to win the tournament which as i remember what i did that year and following years you usually end up qualifying or at least doing well because the only thing you're focused about is trying to win and then if you don't you're somewhere around it versus if you're just setting that threshold as trying to qualify if you don't then you're just underneath if that makes sense so it's i always the golf courses that we played were always great and i enjoyed them and that was a yeah that was a special day,0
justin thomas,0,2021-05,2021,15,1,0,1,have you given any thought about playing your first pga championship without grandpa,i have not until just right now i don't really know what else to say,0
justin thomas,0,2021-05,2021,123,1,0,1,we have two consecutive majors by the water pga championship now u s open in june one on the pacific one on the atlantic how would you compare the two events and the two golf courses,i mean the golf courses are very different other than they're big long golf courses and can play very difficult but the grasses couldn't really be much more opposite you have some of the purest putting surfaces i'm putting on this week and then you have poa annua at torrey pines which we all know is poa annua i mean kind of the sticky kikuyu type rough that they have out there and this is very much not kikuyu here the very thick i guess bluegrass ryegrass but yeah from the few times i've played torrey the wind is blowing substantially more here than it does there but we all know that torrey can play very very difficult when it gets like that,0
justin thomas,0,2021-05,2021,82,1,0,1,so talking about the water you're going to finish your season at whistling straits at the ryder cup that is also by the water talk about that golf course,yeah it's great i played the pga there i think it was in ' my rookie year and i loved it it's a cool venue there's a couple holes out here that remind me a little bit of it just with the just the look of them off the tee and some of the slopes and the way the holes are shaped but yeah it should be a fun week but i still need to solidify my spot on the team first,0
justin thomas,0,2021-05,2021,243,1,0,1,this is the longest golf course in major championship history is that something you guys notice ahead of time or do you have to go out there and experience it and then you may talk about it after the first or second round or whatnot,i noticed it last week when someone sent me a scorecard and i saw that the back nine was yards and i think i actually laughed out loud when i saw it because i was looking at the numbers they can't possibly play it that long unless they get a day where there's absolutely no wind the holes that are going to be back downwind when it comes back into the wind they just can't they can't play that par back if you have this wind today guys are going to be literally hitting driver on that hole unless the pga wants seven hour rounds i wouldn't advise it yes it is extremely long and it plays all of its yardage even when the tees are moved up even when the holes are into the wind i think rickie i was talking to about it last night said it very well where they have that length and they need the tees because for example the par no i think it's yards or something and i had iron in today when it gets this windy and as severe as the wind can get out here they need those tees because the yards can play or yards when you get that much wind and then same thing when you go back into the wind they might to move the tee up to yards to play but yes it is very intimidating looking at the scorecard,0
justin thomas,0,2021-05,2021,155,1,0,1,do you feel an obligation or is it just a personal desire of yours to play,a personal desire i can't imagine what the rush and what the feeling would be of winning a gold medal it's just something growing up i mean growing up i went up on the putting green as a six seven year old putting to win the masters u s open british open pga is a chance to win these tournaments that i watched on tv but i never had the opportunity to watch an olympic golf event because it wasn't a thing it was something you couldn't dream because it wasn't a thing now that it is it's an unbelievable opportunity and i think i've made it pretty known my stance on playing for the u s and representing my country it's a tremendous honor but yeah i guess a long way to answer it yes it's going to be extremely different and not near the experience but i'll make way if i have to,0
justin thomas,0,2021-04,2021,32,1,0,1,how has the birthday been,it's been good i woke up and played with my dog and had a smoothie and came out here but that's a pretty normal birthday on the pga tour just playing golf,0
justin thomas,0,2021-04,2021,269,0,1,1,the players impact program i'm wondering how much you've thought about it since this has come about and also how much will you pay attention to it there's a lot of metrics that go into it how much will you actually pay attention to it and try to figure out where guys stand and things like that,yeah i have a place in nashville so we got the band back together if you will smiley and his wife are in birmingham so it's an easy drive and rick and jordan both weren't playing so we just got together because we don't get to spend that quality time away from a golf tournament really ever smiley and his wife have come stayed randomly at our house when they've been down in south florida i obviously live on the same street as rick so i see him and allison all the time and jordan and annie we'll see at tournaments but it's at tournaments it's not like fun it's like let's go hang out and do whatever we want all day it's like all right we want to go play golf let's go play golf and the girls can rise with us we'll have a couple drinks it's fun we just want to relax and just be the high s year olds we don't want to feel like we're necessarily kind of held into doing what we have to do or like okay i'd love to go to dinner tonight but i have an early tee time tomorrow or whatever it might be it's like hey let's just all get together relax just laugh listen to music just do stuff that we wish we could do but with our busy schedules we aren't able to so i was really glad that we could because they're some of the best people i've ever met and it was nice for us all to be able to spend some time together,0
justin thomas,0,2021-04,2021,113,1,0,1,will you go to kiawah before the pga championship,i don't it's so funny to me every single year on the derby all my friends text me because they think because i'm from louisville i know everything about horse racing there is when in reality i don't i don't know much i do know that it is especially the derby the favorite does win a lot especially it has in the past and that's such an easy thing to say but the cream rises to the top when it's a situation like that yeah to answer your question no i do not i can't give you some in depth analysis and if anybody is listening don't text me because i don't know,0
justin thomas,0,2021-04,2021,321,1,0,1,looking at the tournaments you've won do you consciously take note of those kind of fields the select nature of them and raise your game at all seems like you have a tuning fork that goes off when the field is elite an invitational a major things like that is that something you're aware of and does it make you better,i wish i could say i flip a switch when it's a major or wgc and i play better because i would permanently leave that switch on but i think a lot of it for me goes into the preparation on the mental side of it i feel like i do everything i possibly can before and during every tournament whether it be a regular pga tour event or a major or a wgc or a playoff event whatever it might be it's just different and i hate to say it because you should treat every tournament the same but it's different just the little things like you know maybe going to hit i'm hitting a couple extra balls at home just to get comfortable with that tee shot moving this way or hitting a couple extra irons for the shot into this week or whatever it might be just making sure that i'm not uncomfortable when i get on the golf course in any of those scenarios and i do the same thing in other events but at the end of the day if i'm not in the right place mentally like i'm not in a good frame of mind then it's going to be hard for me or anybody i think to play and perform well i think i make sure that i i think i really really make sure to be rested and in a good frame of mind and control it as much as i can control it and that way i feel like if i don't have my best stuff i can get it around because that's been some of my best and probably some of my golf i've been most proud of is when i've been able to get it around and not have my best stuff and find myself in contention and winning golf tournaments instead of just playing lights out kind of thing,0
justin thomas,0,2021-04,2021,197,1,0,1,so many fringe benefits to winning the masters one of them is the champions dinner you mentioned those practice rounds through the years with tiger and fred i was just curious does it come up do they needle you about not having an invite have you thought about what it would be like to be at it have you managed your menu what is that like,it's a good question i'm trying to think of a nice way to describe them that i can say on the microphone here as needling as they can be towards me they have been nice enough to not bring that up i think they know that i know and that hurts me enough that they don't need to continuously remind me i would say subconsciously they kind of in our practice rounds on tuesdays you know it's like well where are you going tonight or whatever and i'm just like whatever i'm done i get it you guys are going to the champions dinner and i'm eating at my house they have been nice to me and not needled me about that i was fortunate enough to do a champions dinner at the pga it was a really really cool experience and something that you're a part of forever feels like a fraternity it's definitely a fraternity i would love to join in terms of a meal i mean i don't think you don't care you could serve water and i would be pleased as long as i'm there because that means that i've won the masters,0
justin thomas,0,2021-03,2021,175,0,1,1,do you have to learn this golf course because you've had you contended i think in your second appearance here and you've had a top has been your other everything else has been a mixed bag what are your thoughts on attacking this golf course and trying to be successful on it,yeah i haven't decided anything in terms of next week thinking about this event last year i'm staying in the same house we have a friend that lives here and myself rickie and jordan all stay in the same house when i got in sunday i was going upstairs and kind of taking my bags or my girlfriend and i's bags to our room and it was almost a little emotional because the last time i was up there and rickie and i were sitting on this couch with his wife and we're trying to figure out what are we going to do what's going to happen what's going on i've never seen anything like this it definitely brought back some very odd bizarre memories but it is it's crazy to think it's been a year it's crazy to think we're still in it but i'm just proud that the tour has done such a great job that we're now able to have fans or whatever it is this week so it should be fun,0
justin thomas,0,2021-03,2021,243,1,0,1,on that topic based on your kind of i guess bizarre experience of the past year what are you most looking forward to to getting back to normal in the tournament setting and do you feel like this week can be a step towards that,i mean fellow competitors i'm fine with it now i mean i've been fine with it the whole time and we all get tested there's a reason we go through this protocol and we're in the bubble i'm completely fine with interaction with them but in terms of outside that's where it gets tough because obviously everyone is doing most likely what they need to but you just don't know and the unknown it's not the thing for me is it's not selfish i'm not doing it for me i'm doing it for everybody i'm trying to make the proper decisions at home and when i'm not playing for the sake of the pga tour because if i do something that puts myself in harm's way or puts myself in jeopardy of getting the virus then if i come out here and then i were to spread it or was with somebody or sharing a house with somebody and then next thing you know there's an outbreak that's my biggest fear of anything is that i i think that i will be okay if i knew it was just going to be me then i wouldn't have the same worry or fear but the fear of it potentially spreading or getting bigger because of me is my issue because i just want to be selfless in a situation like this and think about everybody else that's involved in the tour not just me,0
justin thomas,0,2021-02,2021,171,0,1,1,is it crazy to think he's not in the masters at this point,i didn't know that and i yeah i don't know i don't really i guess it's hard to have many thoughts because i just heard about it look it seems to be the way gambling and the live gambling on sports obviously as a player selfishly i worry about any sort of sketchiness going on with whether it's communication within someone that's out on the grounds and could potentially yell or do something to affect a person that would have say a wager or something and that's a serious serious concern we're out here playing this is our job and we're out here trying to win golf tournaments and a lot of people are supporting families and supporting themselves i would hope it would never come to that but at the end of the day you can't sit there and tell me that that's not a realistic chance i would hope that it wouldn't happen but i'm sure it'll turn out great and yeah i'm interested to see how it goes,0
justin thomas,0,2021-02,2021,188,0,1,1,nbc is debuting a simulcast this weekend it's a live gambling show and more and more states are coming online with legalized sports getting what are your thoughts and or concerns about what this is going to do for you and for the tour,no if you've got any extra shirts send them my way because i currently can wear whatever i want but it's been enjoyable to try different clothing products and really just wear what i'm most comfortable in if i go to the mall and i see something i like i see a shirt i like i go home and i just get it embroidered with the citi logo on the sleeve it's definitely a bizarre and odd time and my closet is as empty as it's ever been but at the same time it feels right because it's a fresh start and hopefully will be like that most importantly i think lance my manager and i and excel have been great and they understand look this is going to be here whenever you want it but i need to be playing golf but i can't get wrapped up and focused on what clothing deal or whatever i want to do i need to be playing good golf and i need to focus on that that's what's most important right now and whatever happens will take care of itself,0
justin thomas,0,2021-02,2021,195,1,0,1,what did you think of when you walked into it or have you walked into it today,yeah it's interesting i think i've really enjoyed russell on the pac i think the tour has done a great job of bringing some european tour guys in or some guys that have played in european tour events like jon rahm rory but russell i remember bringing up a couple great points about events wgc events that because of different categories and getting exempt into the tournament that we just didn't some people didn't know of i think you can't be very straight lined and one dimensional if you will in terms of who is on the pac or who is making the decisions because you need people from all over and i think russell and rory have both done a great job and they've really given a lot of great input i think any of the candidates are great like you said it would be great in that aspect of having some a little bit of reference of playing more european tour events than your normal pga tour player and hopefully be able to use that to the advantage of making the pga tour better and also the european tour where it's seen fit,0
justin thomas,0,2021-02,2021,11,1,0,1,i know you guys are still voting for a new chairman for the players advisory committee kevin rory and russell of course being american but could you see the benefits of maybe russell or rory being selected for that role in the bigger picture and what i'm thinking about here is the talk of the merger between the european tour and working closely with the pga tour,i have not thank you for reminding me by the way,0
justin thomas,0,2021-02,2021,255,1,0,1,i'm reading between the lines but does that sound like russell may have your vote,i didn't think anything of it when we were on the course like out there that day i think it all really really changed that afternoon and that night i also played in the morning so i was away from the course so a lot of the buzz and probably rumors that were going on at the course i was at home so i didn't know those but i remember when it happened i couldn't believe it i was basically asleep at the house that i was staying at i had no idea how long it was going to go myself and all of us have never experienced anything like it it's crazy if you would have told me that we'd be testing here at the phoenix open in and going to be testing for who knows how many more months i would have told you you're crazy but here we are and like i've said from the beginning i'm totally fine with that i'm happy to be playing on the pga tour and happy to be playing the game that i love against the best players in the world every week it sure beats staying at home and not being able to play i hope that everybody continues to do their job and their part and everyone keeps staying safe it is bizarre to think that we're almost a year removed and we're still reaping the repercussions from all this and it doesn't look like anybody has any idea when it's going to stop,0
justin thomas,0,2021-02,2021,129,1,0,1,we're not that far away actually from a year removed from when this whole covid thing started do you recall what you were thinking that day at the players championship when the world was sort of changing around us and can you think back to what you thought of how long this was going to go on,it's very routine i mean it's never comfortable getting something shoved up your nose so it's not like i go there and can't wait and enjoy to get a q tip shoved up my nose but no it is routine i get in earlier i probably get in on average like a half a day to a day earlier now than i normally would at a tournament and it's fine like i said it's just a part of the norm now it's a part of the routine just like my routine was before and everyone has to do it it's not like it's just me as long as that means we get to keep playing golf and playing out here on our normal pga tour schedule then that's fine,0
justin thomas,0,2021-01,2021,158,1,0,1,what do you think will be key to winning this week,yeah it's been great i was not curious but obviously playing on the pga tour and seeing how they have done it every single organisation sporting group whatever they all do it differently and they all kind of have their own system and for the european tour i would have to think it's difficult travelling country to country each week and with different guidelines and they really have done an unbelievable job i mean from when we started up to now and being able to put these events on and still have great fields week in and week out in terms of me for this week it's been nothing but great in terms of the bubble that you're in and staying within that and following the protocols both on and off the golf course they have done a great job just like the pga tour to making it feel as normal as possible while also not being normal,0
justin thomas,0,2021-01,2021,126,1,0,1,that th green the few years i've been here that seems like one of the toughest greens to read on the pga tour,it is just because it's very rare that you get a straight putt you know i was probably what six seven feet there and i played it about a cup and missed it low i feel like i might have just started it a little bit right there as crazy as it is i would love that wedge shot over again as opposed to the putt that was a pretty easy pin but i totally misjudged the green there in terms of where it was going to come back to but no i mean i wish i would have made the putt but i put myself in a position to win the last couple holes so going into the day today i would say that's good,0
justin thomas,0,2021-01,2021,74,0,1,1,aloha friday talk us through just supporting the aloha friday today,yeah it's great it's always i love any chance to be able to wear a floral pattern and yeah there's not much better place to do it than in hawaii and on friday here i see a lot of people doing it it's pretty normal around these parts for a lot of people that live here but glad for us to be able to do it for a good cause and raise some money,0
justin thomas,0,2021-01,2021,129,0,1,1,MODERATOR,yeah i was very excited to hear that i think it's a great move for the tour for all of us it's become a part of my life i thought it was going to be something i would just kind of wear for a little bit and again it's just it's something that is a part of my daily routine and a part of my routine weekly and monthly and yearly because i'm one to try to pick up on any trends that i can to live a healthier and better lifestyle and hopefully improve my golf game as well because of that hopefully the other guys that haven't been on haven't been on whoop that will now get involved in it will feel and think the same way,0
justin thomas,0,2021-01,2021,267,1,0,1,how good was that note that charlie left for your dad on the drive on saturday,yeah my no priority at this time is the pga tour and playing as many pga tour events as i can that i feel like i have a chance to win and i've always felt i would love to join the european tour one year i would love to have a chance to win the order of merit and have a chance to be able to win both i think that obviously would be unbelievable and so that's something that is important to me and i would love to do at some point but it's just i'm not at that stage of my career i feel like i have a lot more that i need and want to accomplish on this tour first but my thought is playing in abu dhabi was not going to affect any events that i would play in the states and play on the main tour and that's kind of my main philosophy or main thinking is that i'm not going to go play in an event that is going to jeopardize any tour event that i would play in like i knew after last year that i wasn't going to go play sony this year at least and i was because that's always why i haven't gone to play abu dhabi i've had opportunities to go but i love sony i love the golf course and it just isn't realistic to play them both and i knew this year with not playing that one that i would have the opportunity to go over there and not affect my pga tour schedule,0
scottie scheffler,0,2024-02,2024,36,0,1,1,i know we don't have a completed second round but you've put yourself four back of the current lead it's a good spot for you considering you've won from further back here before do you think you've got the three peat well and truly alive,yeah i don't see why not yeah i like where obviously i'd like to be a little bit closer to the lead but still four back out of now is not a bad place to be,0
scottie scheffler,0,2024-02,2024,189,1,0,1,were you familiar with the legend of this tournament at all when you were a kid the tiger ace on or anything like that what comes to your mind about what you thought this tournament was like,that's a good question i might have to go back a few years i think this is one of the tournaments you always paid attention to just i think because of the way no is and that's really kind of what everybody thinks about when it comes to this tournament but the golf course is actually really good as well it's a fun golf course to play and every year we come back there's more and more stuff being built so there's just more and more arena type holes and big crowds like i said it's a lot of fun to hole a footer and have that huge roar there's definitely this tournament maxes out the amount of people they can have out every day and monday tuesday wednesday are a bit busier here than they are at a lot of other stops growing up i always wanted to play on the pga tour and this is definitely one of the events i wanted to be a part of and really feel what has been like and it's been really fun getting to play that hole a few times,0
scottie scheffler,0,2024-01,2024,27,1,0,1,five for five in starts on your pga career here what about this place makes it a perennial start for you,i just love the event it's a great crowd weather's always wonderful pro am aspect is fun and it's just an event that i enjoy to play,0
scottie scheffler,0,2024-01,2024,163,0,1,1,this is the fifth straight year you've been here you've had a couple of pretty good finishes is it just that the weather's good the courses are in great shape or is there something about these courses that fits you,yeah definitely i think it was maybe two years ago here i think this tournament kind of helped jump start me for the rest of the season i think i was outside the cut line by maybe three shots with three holes to go over on stadium course and i chipped in for eagle on and made a footer for birdie on to make the cut on the number then i went out on sunday and had a really good round i finished th or th something like that then after that it kind of jump started the rest of my year i think i played torrey pines the next week and won in phoenix a couple weeks after that and kind of started my run there in so it's a good gauge it's a good practice week it's a fun event to come play and compete it's like degrees where i live right now so it's kind of nice being out here,0
scottie scheffler,0,2024-01,2024,121,0,1,1,coming into the year you're the no player in the world everybody knows you're the no player in the world everybody wants to talk to you like we do thanks for coming in by the way do you think about that or do you just think about the regular kind of goals that you would have for a year coming in whether you were st or th in the world or th,i think once i get out to the golf course especially when i'm at home i play with the same guys every week at home and so it's not really a big topic of discussion for us in our day to day lives i think at night sometimes going out to dinner and stuff like that with the guys out here conversations are a bit different than they have been in the past but that's just because we got some stuff we need to figure out but as far as the preparation goes no it's not overly difficult when i go out there to practice i'm trying to get my work in and i wouldn't say it's a distraction for me,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-10,2023,63,1,0,1,throughout the match you showed a lot of emotion we don't see that a lot when you're playing regular on the pga tour in stroke play what it is about this event that brings out that type of emotion from you,well you know when you got a crowd yelling at you for straight holes it fires you up a little bit and we were fired up to start today with the stuff that went on last night with the crowd and patrick and it was more of that today but that's what the tournament is all about that's why it's so much fun,0
justin thomas,0,2023-10,2023,129,1,0,1,MODERATOR,i personally didn't think so i thought it was really great of zach and the pga to be accommodating to have us come over here and take a little scouting trip and i think that was obviously didn't show but felt it was very helpful it's a very very busy long week with very different routines and schedules that you would have in a normal week and this week the loss that we had this week has absolutely nothing to do with team camaraderie because this is probably the closest team i've ever been a part of we unfortunately just didn't play well enough kind of like max said earlier about sam i can't speak on behalf of everybody but i didn't feel the preparation was necessarily the issue,0
justin thomas,0,2023-10,2023,6,0,1,1,you said a little bit ago that this was the closest team you've ever been on curious now that this event is over is there some sort of example or moment this week that you guys pondered the most whether it was a laugh or a joke,living it up with the baby,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-09,2023,277,1,0,1,if this ryder cup came down to one match left on the course for the whole kaboodle and that's a ton of pressure i would assume if you were to ask all guys here they would want to be in that match they would welcome that pressure do you think that's true and how many do you think are being really honest with themselves,i think in order to get this far in your career you have to have that kind of self belief so i would imagine all of them are telling the truth it just depends on who can perform in that situation when it really comes down to it pretty sure everybody here has won at some level of the game and whether you're at the ryder cup or trying to win a junior tournament when you're a kid it all feels huge so yeah i think they're telling the truth like if you imagine when you're years old like if you can go back that far to when you were when i think of when i was years old winning whether it was a local ntpga tournament or i won a tournament called the future masters once and going down the stretch it felt like the masters because i didn't know any different every tournament was the biggest tournament i ever played to this point ryder cup is probably that way and so when you're in the moment and you're competing in my head it doesn't make a difference whether it's to beat my buddies on i don't want to have to listen to them when we go to the th hole i don't like listening to y'all what is it like coming in second how does it feel well it doesn't feel good it's the same way as it feels losing money in a wolf game it's not fun i'd rather win the money and i'd rather win the tournament and you ask me how much fun it is i don't want to talk about losing,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-08,2023,290,1,0,1,now that the calendar is out for the pga tour i'm curious what are your thoughts on the designated event model that's now the signature event model with those big purses and consolidated schedule now for and beyond,yeah i definitely wanted to end the season on a better note than i did last year for sure what did i learn i think you take something away from every tournament last year i think i just i maybe got i don't know if impatient is the right word in the final round but i just didn't get off to a good start and after that i played really well so i learned about myself that you know how much i like to fight out there and i kind of had a good talking to to myself i think i lost that six stroke lead pretty early in the round i remember walking down number and kind of just having a talk with myself about you know this is why you practice this is why you prepare just kind of give yourself a little pump up speech and then after that i snapped right back in but i think at this time of the year you just get a little bit fatigued to be honest with you it's been a long season and to get to this point now this is our third week in a row and we're going to get some pretty high temperatures this week so it's going to be a grueling week as far as the actual tournament goes so my prep work to start the week's a bit different where it's just mostly focused on getting rest especially coming off after sorry coming off of last week being in contention but i would say mostly what i learned last year is how much fun it is to be in that moment and how much i like to fight and try to compete to win,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-08,2023,48,1,0,1,you and viktor you came into the pga at the same time you were rookie of the year the first year ahead of viktor you had some awesome competitions with him how do you feel like the competition between you and viktor has made you a better golfer,i finished college which i'm proud of but i haven't really had to use it very much thankfully if golf would have taken a different path for me i probably would have had to use it so i'm just very fortunate to not have had to use it,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-08,2023,169,1,0,1,two questions for you what has your college degree done for you,it's just a personal decision like sam burns is one of my best friends and he did two years in college and he doesn't really care about finishing his degree and that's his thing i enjoyed college so much i loved being part of a team i loved i made some of my best friends in college and all those guys are outside of golf and i enjoyed my college experience and it's four years of my life that i wouldn't take back but being out here is pretty fun too so some guys just get really excited to get out here on the pga tour sam would be an example of a guy that kind of made it to the peak in college and felt like it was the right time for him to turn pro but i didn't really have that great of a college career and i liked being kind of a normal kid to be honest with you it was really fun i enjoyed it,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-08,2023,105,0,1,1,my point is you don't strike me as someone who would tell someone how to live their life but there's so many good players coming through if someone was after his first or second year in college and was trying to decide whether to stay all four and get a degree or turn pro what would you tell 'em,as a freshman well i mean in my head it was mostly for the golf my parents kind of pushed the education on me i never really enjoyed school that much the actual school part i think it still gets me a little antsy thinking about taking tests and stuff like that because it was hard but it was fun like i said i met some of my best friends in the whole world while i was at ut and that's why it's a personal decision it's what works best for everybody but for me college was a lot of fun and i enjoyed it,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-08,2023,94,1,1,1,you mentioned we might not see a whole lot of you this fall how involved to you do you expect to be in the governance of the pga tour going forward how focused in are you on this framework agreement or you know potential other futures for the pga tour,i guess definitely i'm most proud of how i've approached each week and my consistency i would say those are the two things i'm most proud of definitely my most consistent year as a professional yeah it's been a really good year as far as a consistency standpoint obviously any time i don't win a tournament i'm disappointed but being a professional golfer i think you try to find a way to live with that disappointment because you just you can win that often but i'm trying my best to do it every week,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-08,2023,4,1,0,1,last one what are you proudest of and what are you most disappointed by this pga tour season,all right thanks y'all,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-07,2023,133,0,1,1,you should remember,i would say a decent amount this week especially around the greens i wouldn't say at home that i chip very much with a pitching wedge or iron just because when you're in the states you're much more dictated by the lie and the grain that you see around golf courses especially where i live in texas you are very dictated by the grain in the bermuda and then as you go up north you're very dictated by what the lies tells you you can do with the ball and over here every lie is pretty scratchy and you just have a lot of options so like today i chipped a lot with my pitching wedge and iron and that's something that i'm just not able to practise but it feels pretty natural,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-07,2023,70,1,0,1,it's a remarkable streak are you saying you're not satisfied because you haven't won every tournament i'm not following,i would say that yeah i want to win every time i tee it up and i think that's kind of how hard it is you win once and you want to win twice it's funny as a kid if you think you win once on the pga tour you'll be satisfied and you win once and it's pretty fun and you want to win again and the cycle continues,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-07,2023,72,1,0,1,secondly how would you describe your interest level in yesterday's senate hearing and as a player on the pga tour is there anything you are concerned or should be concerned about going forward,i just think that yesterday we didn't really learn a whole lot again as a player on tour we still don't really have a lot of clarity as to what's going on and that's a bit worrisome they keep saying it's a player run organisation and we don't really have the information that we need i watched part of yesterday and didn't learn anything so i really don't know what to say,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-07,2023,130,1,0,1,following on from that how disconcerting is the overall uncertainty around the game at the moment for you,for me i just try to keep my head down and play golf i don't get too involved in a lot of that stuff i love playing golf on the pga tour and that's the spot for me i'll hoping that's going to exist for a long time i felt like we were doing a good job before and then the agreement happened and now we have to navigate the whole deal i think the tour is working hard to try to get us more information but like i said it's tough when you're in negotiations to make everything public it's hard to negotiate the public side i understand the privacy of it but i just wish that definitely our player reps need to be more involved in the process,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-07,2023,35,0,1,1,are you surprised that we've got this far into a press conference and nobody has asked you with your putting yet,you know my press conferences it always surprises me sometimes i feel like we get asked a lot of liv golf questions and they never come but this time these questions came a little earlier,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-07,2023,139,1,1,1,sergio garcía told us a few weeks ago that the merger this announcement made some good relationships between the players speaking about rory that he gained friend back do you feel this,when all those guys left i didn't have any hard feelings for anybody if they wanted to go take the money and go over there and play it's their decision it's not my business to get into their business if that makes sense as people i didn't think of them any differently they just play golf on a different tour it doesn't mean that they are different people than they were a year ago as far as my thoughts go no relationships were harmed i'm still friends with the guys i was friends with before some are on liv and some are on the pga tour it is weird that i don't get to see them throughout the year besides a handful of tournaments but none of my relationships were really fractured by them going to the liv tour,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-07,2023,155,1,0,1,you mentioned the communication does that mean that after the board meeting at the rocket mortgage the player reps reached out to the players to inform them and did they ask for your opinion or feedback in any way,yeah i think that's becoming more of a habit with the tour officials as well as the player directors that's important as being a member of the pga tour is that our voice is heard but i feel like our voice it's just kind of how the system we have the player advisory counsel and the player directors as long as the player directors' voices are being heard we are the ones that put them in that position to be there and we want their voices to be heard and that was really the only frustration with the original announcement is that none of those four or five guys were involved at all but as far as how things are going now there's open lines of communication we have had numerous discussions with the tour officials and players as weeks have gone on with stuff and i feel like we're going in the right direction,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-06,2023,124,1,0,1,what goes into thinking and the philosophy of changing before a major like that how much of a big decision is that for you or anyone,i don't ever take decisions on switching equipment lightly i think it's strange that i've been struggling the past few weeks with my putter the pga i actually felt like i rolled it pretty good few putts here or there that lipped out that should have gone in memorial obviously had an off week on the greens or probably would've won that one i mean sometimes you just got to bring another putter around there to make the original one scared i've never really been one to try and overthink things so i try and keep things as simple as possible i looked at that one that's a little bit bigger and i still am kind of undecided on what i think of it,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-06,2023,293,1,1,1,how does teddy help you on the greens,so teddy and i read a lot of putts together i think you've seen that probably the last since he started caddying for me he's a great green reader and he's good mentally a lot of the stuff like i said putting has that finality attached to it where the ball either goes in or it doesn't and you're kind of judged by that and i'm trying to get more and more away from that to where if i hit a really good putt i'm more happy if i hit like a really good iron into a green and i think it's going to be two feet and it comes up feet short i'm not overly pissed off because i'm like wow i hit a great shot and so if i'm sitting on the greens and i can hit really good putts it's a lot easier to live with the results so i would say the pga i did a good job of that colonial i did a fantastic job of that and then i think memorial just i just had a really off week on the greens there i'm most proud of what i did mentally there to still somehow give myself a chance to win when i wasn't putting my best i think that's something that i've worked on over the years out here being on tour is having that kind of mental edge and not taking things i don't know if too seriously is the right word but sometimes i'd let a few bad swings or bad putts ruin my day and i didn't do that and i haven't done that in a while i'm very proud of the kind of consistent results that i've put up on the board,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-06,2023,19,1,0,1,where were you and what was your reaction to the news last week pga tour and pif,i was at the gym i didn't really know what was going on still don't really have a clue,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-06,2023,94,1,0,1,obviously nice turnaround after the first two days where you barely made the cut what was your attitude after coming into the weekend when you are on the cut line and it's unlikely that you're going to contend but here you are,yeah i just tried to bring a good attitude coming in the first two days here were really frustrating it's tough it's the fourth week in a row i'm pretty tired i was in contention at byron pga and colonial and i'm pretty worn out at the moment so i was just proud of how i showed up this weekend and fought i hit it so good and i gave myself a chance made a few more putts go in it's a little different story but i'm not going to go too far away,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-06,2023,258,1,0,1,i watched you work throughout the week it looked like you were working with two different putters spent a lot of time after the round on the greens do you feel like you're making progress,i feel like i'm making progress like i said at the pga i can start feeling the ball coming off the blade again which is good i felt like at the masters and was it hilton head it didn't feel as good this week i hit like even today i just go through my round and i'm like how did some of these putts not go in and i'm thinking like i mean starting on really good putt just stayed high ball's on the edge ball's on the edge i made one from off the green so that probably doesn't count towards whatever stats you're looking at jack's nodding i guess that's true good putt on really the only putt i would like to have back is the putt i misread on but i started it on line and i get to and hit a really good putt burns the edge same thing it's just one of those deals sometimes those putts go in and sometimes they don't jon and i we're playing together and we were kind of joking after the round i think on friday how bad we were both putting but we both were thinking the same thing that some of those putts look like they're going in and about feet away you're ready to go pick it up out of the hole and then it just doesn't fall it's confusing it's frustrating i'm pretty frustrated with it right now but i fought hard i never gave up and i put up a good fight,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-06,2023,4,1,0,1,do you have any sense that when it comes to the proposal of a ball rollback or any other issue that the pga tour players' attitude toward the usga depends on their relationship with them,what do you mean,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-05,2023,120,1,0,1,a big story this past weekend and this week now too is michael block obviously what are your thoughts what he was able to do and what it means growing the game to have a pga pro playing so well last week and now in this event and rbc coming up too,it was awesome we played behind him last week on sunday and listened to the hole in one it was pretty fun it's definitely great for the game of golf the pga professionals really do the hard work for us i grew up at a golf club and my coach is a pga pro he's a proud member of the pga for probably years now maybe he's pretty old i grew up around those guys and they introduced me to the game and taught me how to play any time you see a pga pro have some success is really special we're definitely happy for him and well deserved to get into these two events after his performance last week,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-05,2023,120,1,0,1,do you have any specific memories of coming to this tournament as a kid anything that stands out to you like a special moment you remember,i don't remember specific things but i remember showing up here with my dad and just coming out and watching my dad loved to watch golf when i grew up any time i could get a chance to go to the pga tour it was pretty cool so come out here on practice round days and watch guys i typically liked the practice round days more just because you could get closer to guys and i liked just watching it wasn't as much about the atmosphere it was more just me watching and learning from those guys so just being able to come here and all the pros were always pretty nice to me which is always a nice bonus,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-05,2023,190,1,0,1,what does it say about texas golf and the success that texas golfers have had two favorites in this tournament are both from texas and you both have had so much success on the pga tour in the last decade,if you're going to look for the last decade you're going to look at all of jordan's results i've only been here for a few years jordan he was another guy i looked up to growing up he was always a few years ahead of me and crushing it from a young age so he was always a guy i looked up to and was able to bounce things off of when i was thinking about turning pro when i turned pro he's always been a guy that's given me great advice and he's such a talented player i think growing up here in texas you learn how to play all different kinds of shots i feel like jordan and i are pretty similar in the way we like to play shots we're not really i would say that neither of us really have perfect golf swings to say the least so he's just another guy that i've learned from like i said growing up here you learn how to play just all different kinds of shots and learn how to play the game versus trying to play golf swing,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-05,2023,120,1,0,1,a big story this past weekend and this week now too is michael block obviously what are your thoughts what he was able to do and what it means growing the game to have a pga pro playing so well last week and now in this event and rbc coming up too,it was awesome we played behind him last week on sunday and listened to the hole in one it was pretty fun it's definitely great for the game of golf the pga professionals really do the hard work for us i grew up at a golf club and my coach is a pga pro he's a proud member of the pga for probably years now maybe he's pretty old i grew up around those guys and they introduced me to the game and taught me how to play any time you see a pga pro have some success is really special we're definitely happy for him and well deserved to get into these two events after his performance last week,0

scottie scheffler,0,2023-05,2023,99,1,0,1,absolutely with brooks winning now our understanding is he moves into the top potential ryder cup points to get on the time irrespective of what tour he plays for would you welcome a non pga tour player on the ryder cup team,i want to win the ryder cup i don't care about tours or anything like that i want to win the ryder cup it's something we talked about last year when we finished or i guess a year and a half ago now we want to beat those guys in europe it's been a long time since we've beat them whoever the best guys that make a complete team it's different than individual tournaments we want a team of guys that are going over there together to bring the cup back home and that's all i really care about,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-05,2023,2,1,0,1,so you probably wouldn't be surprised to hear that it was the hardest hole in pga championship history today,no laughing,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-05,2023,102,0,1,1,you've talked about being able to live with whatever the result is and you've certainly displayed that but you haven't been outside the top since last october doesn't that influence your expectations of yourself,i mean not really that's a great stretch of golf i think the last time i really had a poor start like you said was in october so that's good when i show up to a tournament i expect to do my best and try and play well most importantly i just try and have a good attitude and go out there and play i try not to place too much of an emphasis on the result for me it's more about the preparation and showing up to the tournament and having a good attitude and then going out there and competing,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-05,2023,3,1,1,1,we're like one year into this new era with liv and the pga tour and knowing what you know how where do you see this heading,see what headed,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-05,2023,60,1,0,1,professional golf,i mean i don't really know i'm focused on what i'm doing and that's trying to have a good attitude and play good golf i don't spend a lot of time thinking about too much of that stuff for me i'm just trying to sit up here right now i'm focused on pga championship and having a good week here,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-05,2023,9,0,1,1,one liv question for you i had a sense there was great curiosity amongst public press even some players about how this was going to work when liv players and tour players got together at augusta is there any sense that having augusta go the way it did that it's kind of normalized now or did it feel normal to you at augusta,i think it felt normal for me at augusta,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-05,2023,124,0,1,1,being her job was the reason you moved down to texas do you ever think about how your life would have changed if you guys would have stayed where you were,i mean i didn't really know any better i'm sure my parents think about that but yeah they spend some time back in the city now my mom is working up there again so i think they're enjoying being back they're empty nesters now living in the city i'm sure they wonder they took a pretty big risk moving their whole family across the country i think we were eight six four and two when we moved so that's a pretty big change especially when you've got the eight and the six year old in school and you take them out of school in the middle of the year pretty big risk but our family loves dallas and it feels like home to me,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-05,2023,100,1,0,1,just wanted to ask you about the pga championship coming up next week about your thoughts on oak hill have you played it before and if you have your thoughts on the course,i've never played oak hill i've been to rochester once before for an amateur tournament and it was in june and i remember it was really cold so that's kind of all i remember i know that it's a great golf course i've heard it's very challenging i think teddy was telling me that dufner maybe set the record at oak hill last time the tournament was there at like under so a record for a tournament being under means it's typically pretty difficult now i could be totally wrong on that but it sounds like it's a hard course,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-05,2023,112,0,1,1,i've heard you say quite a few times you still feel like the same guy that you did a couple of years ago before you found all the success out here on tour i'm wondering what you've learned about yourself and the connection between mental health and mental wellness off the course and the success that you've found on the course,yeah well for me golf doesn't define who i am as a person if i shoot here tomorrow in the tournament i'm not going to be defined by the and it's going to be the same thing if i shoot i'm not going to be any different because i played good or if i played bad golf is just something that i do it doesn't define who i am and that's pretty much how i'm trying to live i don't want to change because i'm good and i definitely don't want to change if i start playing bad i value the opinions of people close to me and that's what's most important,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-03,2023,224,1,0,1,growing up i don't know how much golf you watched but what did the wgcs mean to you were they different were they special did they stand out,i thought they were growing up i always thought it was really cool to kind of get the best players in the world together the part that didn't make a lot of sense to me about the wgcs was all the other tours that were out here i always found that part to be a little bit interesting i understand it's a world golf championship and you want to get the best players from the world but i think the pga tour's always been a place where those players gathered for instance when i was coming off the korn ferry tour and i looked at some of the fields in the wgcs and they were getting guys from i hate to pick on the sunshine tour but sunshine tour like australia asian tour there were a lot of ancillary tours out there that were getting into these events and i was like well i'm playing here in the states and i'm playing really good like we should also get an opportunity i think right now is you're seeing the pga tour now will be kind of controlling a little bit more of who is going to get into those fields and so i think the wgc fields are going to only get better and now our elevated events are more like kind of wgcs,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-03,2023,141,0,1,1,being a former golfer for ut do you feel more comfortable playing in austin compared to other areas,i definitely feel more comfortable visiting austin i know where i like to eat i know where i like to stay we got great friends that live here and that we can spend time with so when it comes to all the other stuff around a tournament this tournament's one of our favorites just because of the people we get to spend time with throughout the week just good catching up with friends and eating early dinners with them and then kind of sticking to my routine usually we'll go out to dinner at tournaments and it's usually just meredith and me and a couple of our tour friends so it's nice coming this week and seeing some good buddies from college and people that i haven't seen in a little while and going out and spending some time with them,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-03,2023,11,1,0,1,for the last decade dating back to your high school days it seems like you've been checking off some pretty significant milestones along the way whether it's being successful in your only tour event as an amateur walker cup team korn ferry tour player of the year pga tour player of the year at what point along that timeline did you maybe start to feel like you could be as special as things are going for you now,i hit like balls i did not quite beat balls laughing,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-03,2023,101,1,0,1,why did you decide to go there what were you sort of trying to fix,not really i wouldn't say it's something that occupies too much of my thoughts i'm focused on being out here on the pga tour i don't worry about what's going on elsewhere i'm doing what i can to help improve our tour and i think the tour's done a great job of continuing to improve and they're improving at a rapid pace the elevated events have been a lot of fun we've had great great leaderboards good finishes and yeah i mean it seems like it's been a success so far and we're hoping for more of it in the future,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-03,2023,54,1,0,1,it's been days since you walked off in phoenix taking your first pga tour win if you were to describe the last days in one word what would it be,i mean quite a special group of people we could add all our majors and players together and i have two now and they have a lot more than that laughing but any time you can get mentioned in the same breath as tiger and jack it's very special i'm very grateful for that,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-03,2023,89,1,0,1,MODERATOR,i would say that if we were to do that every week i would probably get a little bit worn out i think bay hill's probably one of the most tiring places to play golf on the pga tour i like the variety i like having some tournaments where you can go out there and make birdies like an amex or phoenix and then having weeks like bay hill where you're just going to have to grind it out i like the variety that we have throughout the year,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-03,2023,153,0,1,1,when you're being paired in a group like with jon and rory who have obviously been around a little bit longer and have the attention have grabbed the attention of the world how much does it juice you up knowing that whoever makes the birdies or makes an eagle it's going to produce a roar in the crowd how much does that kind of juice you up when you know the gallery is also pretty stoked for what's going to happen or whatever you guys might deliver,i think anytime when you see stuff on tv it always looks so much larger than life whether it's a person or a hole or a golf course and then you get out there and you're like okay wait like it's a normal sized green and i can do this i was pretty young at the time i was maybe or so to be able to come out here and play this golf tournament was definitely or play this golf course was a very special treat especially as a young kid i was just trying to go out there and have fun with my dad he's always done a good job of helping me enjoy things because i feel like i'm pretty serious when it comes to golf and he does a good job of keeping things light and we went out and had some fun and it was definitely a special memory,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-03,2023,186,1,1,1,i asked max this question yesterday but in your opinion in sort of the world of the pga tour right now with the brysons the brooks koepkas and the patrick reeds that are on the liv tour there aren't many guys at least we may know of that kind of get under the skin of other players at least from what we see on television and hear does the tour need guys like that to generate the sidebar story lines or does just the fact that you have so many guys in the top does that generate enough excitement in your opinion,does the tour need villains i'm not sure i know that there was a lot of buzz in the last few years about like rivalries and stuff like that like the brooks bryson thing really blew up for awhile from my point of view playing out here i view a lot of that stuff as a distraction whether it be i don't know for me it's always best to just try and go out there and just play golf and go from there i don't look to make a lot of noise with my mouth if i'm ever going to become famous or noteworthy or whatever it is out here i'd like it just to be for my golf i don't want to be known as the guy who said the wrong thing or whatever it is i just let my golf clubs go out there and do whatever it is i'm trying to do other than that i'm just trying to live my life so when you talk about the villain maybe from a business perspective i'm not really sure but that's not for me,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-03,2023,182,1,0,1,because the tournaments are pointing in a different way so it is less points per tournaments in europe and the united states,okay i haven't really looked too i haven't looked very deep into the world rankings since it was announced or since the changes i do know that i think some of it's a little bit flawed because golf's such a hard sport to rank i mean when you're looking at football baseball and basketball you get your record and there's more advanced statistics you can look at but golf is so different than all the other sports so i think it's a matter of opinion but no i mean if you can make it here to the pga tour and play good golf i think you get rewarded for it you see a lot of those full field events whether it be a man field they get a lot of points because our fields are so deep out here and then you look at a smaller field like an east lake doesn't draw as many points so there may be more of an opportunity now there may be not as much but always out here you get rewarded for playing good golf,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-03,2023,4,0,1,1,as much as you've said that you prefer to live in the present which you say that pretty much every day how do you balance that with,it's a daily challenge,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-03,2023,147,0,1,1,this is the fourth designated event and they have delivered it seems like the top players together going head to head more often do they feel different to the players to you,i would say a little bit i mean it was rare for us to have these occasions where everybody would kind of be here in the past this year it's been definitely successful i think you look at the guys on the leaderboard each week kind of reflect what we're going for with the new schedule you look at sentry and you had collin and jon going down the stretch then in phoenix you had me and jon and nick taylor which was obviously a great story and he played great golf i think that's the stuff that we're trying to gain i mean if you have a guy like a nick taylor that gets hot he's going to get into those events and he's going to play well and make some noise hopefully it's going to continue to reward guys that are playing their best golf,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-03,2023,111,0,1,1,as far as parts of your game what you're really honing in on as you head to augusta national,yeah i think that's something i'm definitely looking forward to you know try and get kind of reliving the memories out of the way before i show up there because when you show up for tournament week you don't want to be thinking too much about last year you want to be getting ready for this year everybody starts at even if you're the defending champ you got the target on your back it's arguably harder to play well so i'll get kind of a little bit of the memories and stuff like that out of the way that way when i show up on sunday i'm ready for the week,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-03,2023,202,1,1,1,do they abut,yeah i think they have co existed for a number of years out here i think you it just depends on what you're focusing on i'm very grateful to be playing out here on the pga tour we get paid a ridiculous amount of money to do what we do out here but i don't think money is the motivating factor for too many guys you can't really base life decisions when it comes to money when you're out here playing golf tournaments you're never thinking about the money you just want to win the tournament so as being kind of a golf purist that's the motivation i want to be able to play well win tournaments and get the most out of my game money's definitely not a motivating factor for guys out here i believe that they can co exist i know there's a lot of talk with liv and money and guaranteed money and all this different kinds of stuff but the guys out here on our tour i'm excited about the direction of where we're going i mean we're so blessed to be able to play a sport for a living so it's definitely not a motivating factor,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-03,2023,269,1,0,1,what do you think about the micing up of players during saturday rounds,laughing i would tell 'em i think the pga tour's doing a good job of creating an aspirational set of events i think it's something that players will really strive for out here on tour so being able to get into that top for next year is going to be huge for guys they're going to be able to play in those events i mean it's no secret out here that events with less guys are probably a little bit easier on you whether it be playing a practice round or getting guys around for four days it doesn't have the same wear and tear as a man major field does i think it's going to benefit players all across the board purse sizes for the other events are not going down the field sizes are staying the same for those i think it's a better model overall for the tour to have a set of events that are aspirational and that give guys access to those events if you earn your way in to those events the top in the fedexcup this year gets into all of 'em then let's say you have a poor year this year you get injured something happens next year if you perform well either in the fall or early in the year and you're top in the fedexcup and then there's other or sorry top current like not otherwise exempt i mean it's a good way for guys to get access to those events i think it's more of a reward for the guys that are playing the best on the tour,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-03,2023,101,1,0,1,can't it be both,yeah sanderson farms if i showed up and played well i could gain access to those events whereas before i didn't so now with the new schedule and the new ways or the new avenues for guys to get into those events i think it rewards more good golf which is exciting because when i first got out here on tour you didn't have the opportunity to go straight to the pga tour i had to do a year on the korn ferry tour then when i got out here i still didn't have access to some of those certain events,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-03,2023,422,1,0,1,when you look back at when you did break through and start winning last year here being one of them we're only a year removed from that i'm just kind of curious how you would describe just this run obviously in a very short period of time you won your first event became a major championship winner and here you are battling for no in the world how do you put that into words what this is like and how quickly has it happened in your mind,yeah gosh that's a good question i think what's important about our tour is the meritocracy if you play good golf you're going to get rewarded for it and i think we're moving more in a direction where that's the case we're creating more avenues for guys to get out here with pga tour university that's something that wasn't around three four years ago that's something for me coming out of college that would have been incredible it's difficult because you have a certain number of guys that finish college and they turn pro and then they try and get spots whether it be sponsors' exemptions now there would actually be an avenue where i would have gotten maybe into some korn ferry tour events or some pga tour canada events i remember i couldn't even get in a qualifier for pga tour canada because of the way the signup worked there was only certain events that fit in my college schedule and i couldn't get into the right one so then i go from maybe having a spot in memphis i think i had a spot at barracuda and then i think i qualified for the u s open and it was difficult there wasn't really an avenue i was playing korn ferry tour monday qualifiers and playing mini tour events whereas now maybe i would have been on the pga tour canada or korn ferry tour or whatever it is so i think that's what's real special about our tour is giving people avenues to make it out here now i think we're creating more avenues where we're going to get the top tier talent coming out of college and getting out here faster so they can come out here and compete i think the question about whether there's going to be a premier league or not there's definitely going to be an aspirational set of events with those guys but there's going to be avenues for guys coming out of college coming from the lower levels of our tour to get into those events and participate you look at a guy like eric cole last week with his solo second he probably moved up significantly in the fedexcup if we're looking a year's in a year's time he's going to be a guy that is probably going to be on your radar now that may be on the bubble to getting into some of those tournaments and have the opportunity to participate against the best players in the world,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-03,2023,2,1,0,1,as we go down this path for the new schedule and maybe we go to the limited fields and everybody else goes to the other events and purses aren't going down at some point on this path do we create a in essence a pga tour premier league and a pga tour regular league,thank you,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-01,2023,198,1,0,1,going back to what you do in the off season how much do you and randy kind of dig into the strokes gained stats in between seasons and what was sort of the focus short off season but this off season,well i don't know if it would have changed my approach it definitely would have encouraged me to move further up the leaderboard i definitely got a little conservative in the last round and i kind of had to skate by there at the last second so it may have helped me at the time to get to the korn ferry i don't know if it would have helped me get to the pga tour but i think it's a good opportunity for guys i think it's something that you deserve after i mean it's pretty grueling to go through q school especially if you start at first stage like i did it's a long few months i think it's good to give the guys a reward there at the end yeah i think more opportunities for guys to get out here is better because you want to reward good golf wherever it is if it's at q school or on the korn ferry or pga tour canada latin america wherever it is you want to reward good golf so i think that's a nice improvement by the tour to start giving spots again to the pga tour,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-01,2023,34,1,0,1,starting this year q school is going back to five and ties are going to get pga tour cards what is your take on that and do you think it would change your q school approach from back in the day knowing that that's the scenario,chandler was always he's a east texas guy i've known him for a long time he's super talented he's a really talented player i'm sure you'll see his name pop up here pretty soon,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-01,2023,153,0,1,1,he just won today,i think you've seen kind of more players become more involved in stuff with the tour in the past year i think with liv that's kind of an obvious deal that we had to make a few changes in order to improve our tour in a different way so for me having an opportunity to be on the pac and talk with guys across all different levels of our tour whether it's a guy finishing th on the money list or st it's kind of nice to be in the room and have those conversations and figure out what is collectively going to work best for all of us so that this tour can succeed i just want to be in a position to help so it should be a good year for us on the pac and we got a good group of guys and hopefully just continue to improve our tour,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-01,2023,20,1,0,1,what i mean is do you get a sense that people looked at you at no just because it happened so quickly a guy who went from zero to in three seconds,augusta is good i like augusta u s open is at lacc pga's at oak hill where is the open,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-01,2023,153,0,1,1,but you never felt like you had to live up to it,yeah those are the events on the schedule that you get extra excited for and so if i'm playing the week before i have to really focus on being present for that week because the majors are right around the corner having not played the golf courses it's really difficult i think major championships set up well for me i like the aspects of those tournaments where they're very challenging i kind of like the grind of those tournaments where a par is a great score where the easier golf courses i don't think mentally i get as excited for me the majors are kind of exciting because you feel like you're going into a boxing match you're going in to really fight the golf course and stuff like that and those are really fun so as far as the golf courses go i think you just know they're going to be challenging,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-01,2023,149,0,1,1,what's it like to be here this week with things a little bit different than the last time a designated event of the top here what's it like to be here this time for you,yeah i haven't seen many of the liv guys i saw bubba on vacation this year and i told him that i was just going to have a separate table for him in the corner by himself laughing only kidding obviously in the world of golf i think it's definitely a little sad what's happening it's kind of weird this week i get to my locker and my locker's next to cam smith's locker because he's a past champ here and he's not here so it's a little strange but golf will move on i think this stuff just takes time things will heal and we'll see what happens all that stuff is not really for me i can only show up and just try and play good golf and i'm not going to liv anytime soon and so it's not of a concern for me at the moment,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-01,2023,90,1,1,1,he was just saying because obviously it's the first masters post schism liv era and he was saying it's going to be the first time that a lot of those people are in the same room together in a little while,yeah and that makes sense i think there's so many history with the game and the pga tour and augusta i think for a few weeks a year we can put all that aside especially with augusta national being such a special place and with the history of the game and whatnot i think we can put all our stuff aside and just get together for a fun meal all in a room together and just kind of celebrate the game of golf and augusta national and just hang out,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-01,2023,47,1,1,1,what area is important to you going forward,pga we're not going to southern hills where else you'll find out i would need some thinking we get spoiled out here on tour so places i would like to go back the least there really isn't one i get to live my dream of playing golf,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-01,2023,10,1,0,1,pga,yeah i like that one too that's a fun week,0
scottie scheffler,0,2023-01,2023,38,1,1,1,memphis,no answer we get spoiled out here we play the best golf courses against the best competition and i get to live my dream playing out here on the pga tour so i'm just grateful for the opportunity,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-09,2022,78,1,0,1,it's no secret you guys are the favorites here how do you approach that mentally,i just try not to focus on it i think the best approach is usually just going out and trying to do your best and most of that involves ignoring the outside noise just because you're the favorite they don't give you any extra shots we don't start up there's a lot of talented players on the pga tour its' a very deep tour and the internationals obviously have a lot of talent on their side as well,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-09,2022,58,0,1,1,today liv golf requested world ranking points for their tournaments can i get your thoughts on that,yeah i don't know how the world ranking exactly works i don't know the ins and outs of how they deem tours eligible for world ranking points there's a board that does all that kind of stuff so for me i don't really have much to say on that i don't really know it's not up to me,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-09,2022,88,1,1,1,i'm not sure if you saw but liv golf requested world rankings how do you feel about that issue,i mean that's not up to me that's up to the official world golf ranking i play golf on the pga tour honestly i don't have much to say i don't know the ins and outs of how the system works if those golf tournaments are deemed eligible if hole events count guys it's challenging there's lots of ins and outs to that i don't think my position in the world ranking has any sort of effect on whether those guys will get world ranking points or not,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-09,2022,79,1,0,1,how do you fight off being overconfident after everything you read,i mean for me it's always just been ignoring all that kind of stuff just because we're favorites doesn't mean we start up every match starts at even at the beginning of the week the pga tour is very deep and the international team is also deep there's a lot will talent out on tour just going out and trying to do our best is probably going to be the best approach and just ignoring all that other stuff,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-09,2022,26,1,1,1,if there were ever a liv golf and pga tour event indiscernible,it's a big hypothetical i'm not quite sure yeah i have no idea i don't know if we're going to see that anytime in the future,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-09,2022,24,1,0,1,is there any kind of talk in the team room about fantasy golf like their best against pga tour's best what that would look like has that ever been discussed,not in my circles i think the pga tour has a bit more talent than their tour does i don't have much to say,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-08,2022,119,0,1,1,at any point during this week do you allow yourself to think about the money because it is so much more here than any other event,yeah the money is great obviously playing professional golf for a living is such a gift for me i don't play golf for money i play to win tournaments and i play to have fun and do my best and see where the game can take me today the money definitely didn't creep into my mind i wanted to win the season long title i've had a really great year and i wanted to finish it off with a win here and unfortunately i wasn't able to do that but at the end of the day it's such a gift to be out here playing golf for money and i can't i'm just so thankful to be out here,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-08,2022,105,1,0,1,what's it like when you have to complete that round i'm sure you've been in this situation before but on a final sunday of the conclusion of the pga tour season,yeah i haven't been in that position before but it'll be a little new but at the end of the day it's still a golf tournament and i've been in some intense situations this year the masters definitely being one of them and the other three tournaments and kind of the start stop of the match play would definitely be something that would be similar to tomorrow even though they're going to be playing less golf in the morning but i've got kind of a good routine that i go through in between rounds and it looks like we'll have a bit of a buffer,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-08,2022,45,0,1,1,you've already had an amazing year a year to live so long in the memory your first career major the masters title how badly do you want to win this event the fedexcup to really cap off the icing on the cake on an amazing year,yeah it would definitely be the icing on the cake for the year i've played some tremendous golf this year at times and overall i've had what i feel like is a great year and just going to try and keep it rolling this week,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-07,2022,333,0,1,1,i don't know how big you are on watching youtube videos and things like that but if you watched a lot of open golf championship on youtube videos or on live telecast when you were growing up which is maybe one moment or one tournament or one shot that really stood out for you that maybe you think wow this is really different,so going into this week yeah i like youtube big youtube fan i've watched they have like i don't know exactly what they're called but each open they have an hour long video where they don't show as much golf as i'd like to see but they show enough i watched the coverage of when zach won in ' and the wind was a different direction but i'll sit and watch that stuff because i want to see where guys hit it you can learn a lot from watching stuff like that i did that before the masters too brookline there wasn't as much information and southern hills they changed but i do learn a lot from stuff like that i think what i always go back to is people telling all these legends where it's like one day i hit iron lob wedge into a hole and the next day i hit driver wood because the wind was blowing so hard you don't really believe it then you come out for the first time and see it and you're like wow that makes complete sense a lot of the shots you see i always think where tiger hit that wood and he's aiming at a certain mound and he hits the mound and it kicks it down out there onto the green and he hit a perfect shot and it was yards away from the pin so stuff like that guys have different strategies for playing links golf and different things work for different people and i'm still trying to figure mine out a lot of it is plotting your way around the golf course and trying to avoid the silly errors because you can all of a sudden get in one of these pot bunkers and it will take you three shots to get out and all of a sudden you've wasted two shots on a single hole at the end of the week that's going to make a huge difference,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-07,2022,7,0,1,1,for a guy who lives minute by minute have you found the joy of winning lasting longer than the sting of losing which lasts longer,i would say the joy of winning,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-07,2022,118,1,0,1,what did you like about lahinch,you know the beginning was really fun we had like people following our group which you know was definitely not expecting coming off of a redeye flight no stretching and warming up and right on the first tee and everyone is sitting there watching you we warned them starting the round you won't be seeing what the no player looks like and jordan as a three time major winner and sam as a pga tour winner look like but we were cutting up with the people following us a bunch of kids out there we had a great time with and the views were awesome and the weather was really good just cut up and had some fun,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-07,2022,239,1,0,1,with the rival tour discussion everyone's opinion is important and i think when you rise to world no suddenly your opinion becomes extremely important have you felt more people on tour around tour wanting to know your opinion on a lot of different things now that you are the guy kind of at the top of the table,somewhat so i think from a player's perspective yes i'm friends with a lot of various a lot of guys at different levels of our tour so everybody has different concerns and those concerns need to be addressed i think the pga tour is doing a really good job of continuing to evolve and address those concerns you have rory mcilroy and tiger woods at the peak and then you have other guys that are trying to keep their card and it's a big balance fortunately for me from the outside perspective evident we have guys like rory and tiger that are very involved with what the pga tour does and they are doing everything within their power to help improve the pga tour all of those discussions are behind closed doors as being the no player in the world i'm not anywhere near the top dog out here there are a lot of guys have been carrying this tour for years jt jordan rory tiger those guys are with the pga tour as far as i'm concerned wherever those guys are going that's where i'm going to be the pga tour has done a really good job of continuing to evolve and improve our tour like i said there's discussions going on behind closed doors on how we are going to move and i think the tour and the players are going a great job of doing that,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-06,2022,469,1,0,1,there seems to be something about this tournament that produces exciting finishes it seems like year after year there's a sunday that produces fireworks is there something about this course setup or this tournament in particular that leads to that and do you think that might have something to do with the strength of field that continues to show up here each year,so i'll start with the brooks thing that was definitely a surprise for me i was at a function with him last week and definitely wasn't what he had in mind we were focused on building the pga tour and getting the guys that are staying here together and kind of just having talks and figuring out what how we can help benefit the tour so to see brooks leave was definitely a surprise for us with that being said he's made his decision i'm not going to knock him for doing that he made the decision that's best for him and i'm not going to be one to judge him on that for me it's not where i see myself heading anytime soon i grew up wanting to be on the pga tour i grew up of dreaming of playing in these events i didn't grow up in playing in the centurion club in london or whatever it is or in i grew up wanting to play in the masters i grew up wanting to play in austin i grew up wanting to play colonial the byron nelson i wouldn't trade those memories for anything at this moment in time those memories to me are invaluable i would never risk going and losing the opportunity to bring go back to augusta every year or to do any of it there's nothing that i would want to do right now that would risk having any sort of affects on the way my life is now the second part of your question concerns for the tour i think most of the guys are still have a lot of faith in what the tour is doing the tour is doing everything in their power to make it the best tour for all the players out here and i think we getting behind jay as our leader and just kind of figuring out what's best for the tour i think we released something today about some new events and new bigger purses and right now the best players in the world are still on the pga tour the guys on top of the leaderboard last week were on the pga tour canada was one of the coolest events that i've been to and it was my first time up there being able to play in front of the crowds and have those really euphoric moments where you're actually able to make a putt to win a tournament like finishing out the masters and becoming no in the world in austin are memories that i can never ever come close to replacing with an amount of money so for me i'm not looking towards anything being able to take that away from the guys that have chosen to stay out here on tour,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-06,2022,207,0,1,1,two part question being in the same management stable were you surprised by brooks' decision and secondly do you have any concerns about the immediate future of the tour,well firstly up until today i had two questions the entire year about liv golf literally and one of them was off camera and the second one i kind of put my foot in my mouth a little bit in canada and so now i feel like i'm a bit more prepared to answer questions about it but at home yeah we talk about it it's definitely interesting you have this government and the investment fund doing all these things to kind of try and attack our tour some guys are going and some guys aren't it's definitely confusing for us as players there's just a lot going on so at home not much discussion definitely on the range there's a little bit but at the end of the day if guys are going to want to go they can leave and like i said i'm not going to sit here and judge them for that it's up to them they're going to make their decision and they know what's best for them i don't know what's best for their lives at the end of the day that's probably hopefully that's always going to be my position i don't want to be getting in anybody else's business,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-06,2022,220,1,1,1,rory was mentioning a little bit about the fatigue level starting to set in for him after four tournaments in a row so where is your fatigue level at this point and how do you measure that and decide when is a good time to take a break and when is not a good time to take a break especially after a major,i don't think so i think if there was there's a place you can find it now laughing like i said the money that we have on the pga tour i never dreamt of playing for this much money as i do now i mean i can't i don't know i don't know how much money i've made this year but it's definitely more than i deserve for whacking a little white golf ball around for me the memories that i have playing on this tour and the dreams i have of wanting to be on this tour and it can't be replaced by anything financial money's money and it's not something that i'm trying to let control how i live my life like rory said when you're making decisions purely based off of financial reasons and fear based stuff it doesn't always work out what's best for me it definitely hasn't worked out best in the past whatever i was doing if i was doing it purely for financial reasons for me it's not what works for other people maybe it is i'm not going to sit here and tell them what they should or shouldn't do for me playing golf on the pga tour is well compensated plenty for how i for what i do for a living,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-06,2022,4,1,0,1,is there any amount of money that would change your mind about staying with the pga tour,during the fall schedule,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-06,2022,611,1,0,1,going off of what you said before about fatigue something a lot of the players have been discussing is the fall schedule and how it is the golf calendar is just full weeks so and you mentioned before about how what they're going to announce new events and stuff like that what do you think would be best for the tour to do during that portion of the schedule and what's going to come,yeah the tour's really bounced around a lot with their format of the fall series and stuff like that personally i think building an off season into golf would be good for me it's always been hard kind of managing whether it would be stuff at home with our friends if someone's getting married if our friends want to go on a vacation that stuff's always really hard to plan around so for me even if it's a month just being like hey december for us has always been kind one where it's like you know we could have time here but it's still difficult so just having a little bit of an off season would be nice but that being said i like playing golf i've always been a guy that plays a lot of events i'm sure when i start having kids and life changes off the golf course i'll slow down but for right now meredith travels with me every week and we have a great time out here on the pga tour in terms of what they could do i think guys always appreciate let me think trying to figure out how to word it i think there's a good balance between rewarding people for good play and punishing those that may or not punishing but like when i came out on tour you always had those world golf championships so maybe having a few events like those back where those guys at the top of the fedexcup for that year or the top of the world ranking or whatever it is will be able to have an opportunity where it may be a smaller field event those don't hurt but there's got to be a good balance between giving guys that are either struggling to keep their card or coming up from the korn ferry tour where they get rewarded for good golf and they can get into those events and be a part of those whatever we can do to get the best players congregated more often and have the guys that haven't made it to the top yet have plenty of opportunity to work their way into those events and into those fields and have opportunities at those tournaments but whatever we can do i think as a pga tour to get the best guys playing against each other at the most often i think is what will work best for the tour in the future so like i think canada turned out like a fantastic turned out such a fantastic event because of the guys you had in the final group you had tony rory and jt playing in the final group i mean if you love golf who wouldn't want to watch that you have three historically great players in our game going and competing for the same trophy whatever i think we can do as a tour to have more of that would be beneficial but like i said you have to have avenues for guys that may not be at the top right now to be able to work their way into those events and have opportunities because i think one of the strengths of the pga tour is the level of talent we have across the board and so you'll see it at events like this where a guy like a kramer hickok last year may not have been someone that was looked at a lot at the beginning of the week to win that golf tournament but he very easily could have won this tournament last year and guys like that always need to have opportunity out here,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-06,2022,67,1,0,1,you mentioned the pga trying not to get too high not get too low during this whole year how does that help you in or around when you can have back to back bogeys or that shot on and then have the back nine you did,yeah staying patient i knew i was swinging at it well really i was over through and hadn't really made a bad swing yet but that's just u s open it's just hard i kind of lost focus there on and and then got right back into it and just played really good after that i hit pretty much mostly all good shots from there on in,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-06,2022,71,0,1,1,your roommate was just here sam he was talking what's going on at the house this week that's letting you guys both play so well,i don't know if we knew we'd probably do it every week yeah not too much just dinner hanging out his coach is staying there and then teddy is staying with us as well it's been a fun week you came in here perhaps flying under the radar a little bit because of all the talk about liv do you feel that somehow helps you without having that spotlight on you,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-06,2022,73,1,0,1,there was a period this season where every time you hit a ball you were picking up a trophy then not so good at tulsa,yeah i feel like i'm kind of an under the radar person i don't really feel like there's much chatter going around with me rory won last week tiger was at the pga i've been no in the world for a while now and it doesn't really feel like it so i kind of like just under the radar i can show up and do my thing and then go home and rest,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-06,2022,92,1,0,1,when you say rory gets maybe more of the attention or other people like justin thomas can act almost like a spokesman for the pga tour sometimes you're world no are you glad that they take some of that pressure off or do you feel like you would like to take more of that,well those guys have been on the pga tour for a long time justin thomas has won like times and two majors rory has won four majors and like times on the pga tour those guys are definitely going to be more the spokespersons and take the limelight because they deserve it they've won so many golf tournaments i kind of like flying under the radar so for me it makes things a lot simpler those guys carrying our brand and i'm really happy that they do what they do for us,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-06,2022,116,1,0,1,seems like in some ways this is kind of an ideal u s open leaderboard some major winners some guys who found out on friday they were going to be here are there guys who are in contention that you had never even heard of or weren't familiar with them before,no i'm pretty familiar with most of the guys i've said this before a lot the pga tour is very deep and extremely talented you guys may be surprised to see certain people up on the leaderboard but i think most of the guys out here aren't that surprised because there's so many talented guys especially when you're playing a golf course as difficult as this if you're playing your best you're going to be there at the top no matter how good your career has been in the past or if you're just getting started whatever it is if you're playing good golf you're going to get rewarded for it on a test like this,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-06,2022,142,1,0,1,going back to the pga you missed the cut you hadn't missed a cut in a major for a while before that i'm wondering how do you what do you make of that what do you do after that do you kind of just push it to the side and say okay we move on or are you kind of analyzing what happened there at that stage how do you kind of go about working through that,it's really good i think it's a nice stretch you play which is a really difficult hole trying to remember the routing because the routing was different for us is now a par which you can get at but it's a pretty hard par then is a really good par being a short hole where it's a kind of a birdie bogey then if you get it in play or in the fairway off the tee it's a good birdie opportunity i think it's really cool i'm not necessarily a huge fan of those golf courses where there's always hazards coming down the stretch for me it seems more classic of a golf course like this one where it's just rough and bunkers and it's more of a birdie bogey type of situation i think that's really a cool style of golf,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-05,2022,68,1,0,1,you kind of had a bit of a bumpy start at the nelson before you finished strong and obviously the pga last week what do you make of the stretch you've had back here at home and with the pga the last few weeks how you've played,yeah i played solid at the nelson on that golf course i think i had one bad hole which really kind of makes things difficult out there with how many birdies there are the pga i just kind of got on the wrong side of things and i didn't play good and i just made too many errors and that's what's going to happen in a major championship,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-05,2022,172,1,0,1,more philosophically does seem like you're cool with bunkers playing as like a proper hazard whereas like a lot of times on the pga tour it seems like it's almost an automatic up and in do you like seeing them be more penal,you know it depends i think if you were to go look at golf years ago and people kind of appreciate bunkers being true hazards but now with there being so many around the green you really kind of need a good lie how fast the greens are and i don't really think it should be up to pure luck on whether or not you get a good or a bad lie in the bunker so when they're in really great shape i think as players we all appreciate it just because it's kind of like getting in a divot in the fairway there's certain bunkers where you know it's an okay miss and i think a lot of the traditional golfers or i don't know how you say that but when you look at how golf used to be played with much slower greens and longer clubs going in it was much different than it is now i think we all appreciate on tour having bunker sand that's really really good,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-05,2022,237,0,1,1,how does it affect your confidence not just the accomplishments but everything you've done this year,yeah i don't really look too far into the future so i don't i had not really thought much about this week until i showed up here we did come play a practice round but outside of that i was still preparing for last week i don't know that's kind of stuff for y'all to write it like i said i don't really get too high or too low if y'all want to write up stuff and come up with stories that's fantastic but for me you know i'm going to try not to read them whether they are good or bad living in the moment is usually what works best for me and like i said i don't want to get too high or get too low so if you guys are really building me up then you know i may prepare not as or i may not prepare as hard because i show up being like i'm the guy i'm the man and no one can touch me that doesn't work for me and if i show up too low then you guys are saying oh scottie doesn't have it he's not any good anymore then i'm going to show up and maybe i'm going to prepare too hard i'm not going to get enough rest so for me kind of staying in my own lane and doing my own thing is what works best,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-05,2022,226,1,0,1,wondered if you had played any practice rounds with jordan this week or any coming up and also you and jordan are playing really well at the same time you've known him your whole life have you thought about how fun that would be if you got to come down sunday you and jordan are battling for the pga championship like you have so many times back at home,you know i feel like it's one of those places where you kind of get on the tee box and you look at the hole and are like man this is a really cool hole and then you get to no and you're like man this is a really cool hole and it just keeps going i wouldn't say there's one hole that stands out too much than any other it's a really solid golf course what i found interesting with playing the big championships here there was always one day it seemed like where somebody kind of blitzed the golf course and shot under but i think i won the golf tournament like or under it's a really hard golf course but when you're playing great golf you can kind of make your way around it just because it's so simple and i don't know it's just kind of a funny place when it comes to stuff like that i'm not sure what tiger won with here in but it was also one of those deals where he had a crazy round and almost shot a it's one of those places where if you can put your a game together for a round you can really make it special i don't think you're ever really going to find yourself too far out of the tournament,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-05,2022,124,1,0,1,so it's really at the forefront of your mind is what you're saying,you know we'll see how it feels during the round right now i don't feel in a tournament i want to win this tournament as bad as any other one for me not much changes whether it's pga championship masters british open whatever it is i'm an extremely competitive person i want to win for me winning is fun you know it took me awhile to win the first one and i guess i've been on a stretch now but outside of that being in contention and winning golf tournaments is the most fun finishing th place is not as fun you know the higher up you can finish and the more nerves you feel that's kind of the more fun stuff for me,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-05,2022,165,1,0,1,xander mentioned like how important it is to have tournaments close to home when you're on the road a lot and to be able to stay in your own bed so between the puck drops the first pitches now a home tournament how important is it to have moments and times like that in busy season in between majors and things like that,yeah so i haven't been able to talk to anybody else so far today the news came out last night we had a busy night at our house last night so i didn't really see it until i was going to bed i woke up this morning and did my pro am and now you just asked me so i haven't really processed it very much i guess first thoughts would be i kind of figured that was something that would happen if you're playing here on the pga tour playing in something that could be a rival series to the pga tour being a member of our tour it's definitely not something where we want our membership to do because it's going to harm the tournament that we have opposite that and that's i'm sure that's why they were why they did not release the players because if we have guys go over there and play that hurts the rbc and the canadian open,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-05,2022,114,0,1,1,one piece of news that's out there that just came down yesterday about the tour denying the waivers to the liv invitational i wanted to get your reaction to that and if you've talked to other players in the locker room and sort of what the collective reaction of that might be,so college golf fellowships was important to me had a pretty significant impact on my life and so and be able to give back to that foundation and share some of my experiences with younger guys is really important and it's a really fun weekend too we had a good time out there last year i've done that now that was my third year and to have sam be a part of it as well was really fun for the both of us and if some of our experiences can have a positive experience on some of those guys lives then that's something that we're going to want to do for a long time,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-04,2022,61,1,0,1,many congratulations and thank you very much for your time so eight weeks ago today you have your first pga tour victory you now have four wins in your last six starts could you ever imagine back then how this was all going to play out and other than due to the fact you played great golf did you ever see this coming what do you put it down to,that's the coolest part about this whole deal this is such a fun golf course it's such a fun piece of property i mean it's augusta national it's about as cool as it gets it's so fun to play i just can't i can't believe that i can come back for a lifetime and get to enjoy enjoy this golf course,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-04,2022,144,1,0,1,how pivotal do you think the chip in was at the third hole,yeah i grew up around so many guys out there just watching them and learning from them i wore pants when i was a kid at royal oaks because i wanted to play golf on the pga tour i would wear pants and a collared shirt to like third grade class and get made fun of rightfully so i always wanted to be out here and i never expected it i never you know i never expected to be sitting where i am now you know you don't expect things to come to you in this life you just do the best that you can and with the hand you're dealt and just go from there i never really thought i was that good at golf so i just kept practicing and kept working hard and that's just what i'm going to keep doing,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-04,2022,200,1,0,1,how much did the growing up in the shadow of so many pga tour players at royal oaks shape your interest in wanting to be a golf pro,you know last night was pretty easy i was tired we went and got some food i spilled my dinner in the car on the way home and that was extraordinarily frustrating you can see meredith is still laughing at me she thought it was the funniest thing ever i didn't think it was so funny at the time last night was fine this morning was a totally different story i cried like a baby this morning i was so stressed out i didn't know what to do i was sitting there telling meredith i don't think i'm ready for this i'm not ready i don't feel like i'm ready for this kind of stuff and i just felt overwhelmed she told me who are you to say that you are not ready who am i to say that i know what's best for my life and so what we talked about is that god is in control and that the lord is leading me and if today is my time it's my time and if i shot today you know somehow i was going to use it for his glory gosh it was a long morning it was long,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-04,2022,88,0,1,1,i don't think anyone could have suspected your stomach is hurting were you faking us out,yeah i'd say so like i said earlier what meredith told me this morning is that we are not in control of our lives and so i spoke a little bit about what playing golf for me is like and why i do it my faith affects all aspects of my life not just my life on the golf course the lord has given me a skill and i'm trying to use it for his glory outside of that i'm just out here trying to do my best,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-04,2022,192,1,0,1,i heard you are a religious man did your faith play a significant part in this victory,oh yeah i played tiger's irons wore his shoes wore his shirt this week yeah tiger on the golf course is just ridiculous he's done so much for the game of golf i spoke about it a little bit at the beginning of the week we are so glad to have him back out here he is the needle for the game of golf he has completely changed the pga tour from when he came on years ago or maybe now and his youtube clips are such an inspiration for me i remember watching the highlights of him winning in ' kind of running away with it and he never really broke his concentration that's something that i reminded myself of today i tried not to look up i tried to keep my head down and just keep doing what i was doing because i didn't want to break my concentration the minute i did was on green when i finally got on there and i had a five shot lead and was like all right now i can enjoy this and you saw the results of that laughter thank you tiger,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-04,2022,81,0,1,1,does your heart rate go up,they can if they want to i was born there i lived there i think for five years the only thing i remember was our backyard i used to just hit golf balls in the backyard hit them over the house really all i remember was the backyard we had one of those little things where you could throw the baseball against yeah that's where i spent most of my time was out in the yard so that's all i remember,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-04,2022,82,0,1,1,here with our hole leader of the th masters scottie scheffler scottie it was a first for you sleeping on an overnight lead in a major championship you leave tonight with the lead again emotionally how did it feel out there knowing that everybody was looking at you,i felt pretty comfortable i don't really mind people watching me if you play this game for a living you kind of get used to people watching i had a lot of fun out there i talked about at the beginning of the week that being in contention is what's fun so being in the lead is fun when i'm in the lead i'm trying to stay in the lead and not really overthink things just go out there and play golf,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-04,2022,58,1,0,1,a lot of the top players on the pga tour play one predominant shot shape and they stick to that regardless of the course how many different shots do you feel like you're playing throughout the course of a round here,a lot yeah i couldn't put a number on it i mean every shot is a little bit different i have different feels for different things but every shot is pretty much different especially when you get to mile an hour gusts out there i mean every shot is its own challenge for sure around this golf course,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-04,2022,176,0,1,1,when you said it definitely felt like a fight today what was the hardest part of that fight for you strictly the wind or was it i mean,i think so two parts the wind and then trusting the other aspects of your game when the wind is this high it's hard to make putts and it's hard to get the ball up and down but if you try to force your way around this golf course you're going to get yourself into trouble really really quickly and make a big number for me my goal and what teddy and i talked about at the beginning of the day was just being committed to the shots because the wind is going to move around you're going to get bad bounces you're going to get bad gusts all these things are going to happen because the golf course is playing so tough but if i'm committed to my shots i'm able to live freely in that and know that i did my best to hit a good shot and i didn't let the conditions or whatever it is bother me i just hit a good shot and it didn't work out it's not overly complicated,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-04,2022,225,1,0,1,i've been asked a lot of questions what are you like i am asked what you are like and i try to give as clever an explanation as i can but i have no idea what you're like other than being a very very good golfer could you describe what you're like when you're not a golfer,i would say that i always believed in myself and i believed i could perform on this stage my dream like i said was always just to play on the pga tour i felt like if i could make it out here i would learn how to compete so for me my first few years out here i was learning so much and the ryder cup was such a great experience i'm so grateful to be part of that team it's always different feeling what that pressure's like in person you believe in yourself and you prepare for that moment and you hope for the best but then when you're actually in that environment you're able to perform well and you feel those nerves when i go home and i practice and prepare i'm preparing knowing exactly what it feels like to be on kind of the biggest stage in golf with cameras and whatnot on you it's a lot different when you're actually preparing knowing what it feels like for you because you can hear somebody describe it and tiger can talk about being in the moment but you don't really know what it feels like for you until you actually do it so having that ryder cup experience has been great for me just knowing how to prepare for being in these moments,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-04,2022,162,0,1,1,would you say the world no came sooner than you expected,i wouldn't say i feel a desire i think letting people in is not necessarily a bad thing for me i like to be pretty private i like to be able to live a normal life and so when i'm at home my wife and i live a very normal life we don't do a whole lot of crazy stuff i think i do feel a touch of a responsibility if i do have some fans or people that want to see me have success to let them in so i've gotten a little bit more involved in the social media kind of stuff but for me that kind of stuff it just doesn't come naturally i never really look at social media much i don't really do too much to grow my brand i just love being out here and i love competing so for me that's where i get the most joy is just coming out here and playing golf,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-04,2022,113,1,0,1,scottie what kind of challenge does walking this course for four days present that maybe you don't see at the other tour stops,i think just playing major championship golf especially around a golf course like this where you have to be so focused for all the holes you can score well in some spots out here and if you're playing poorly you're going to get yourself in trouble really quickly so the level of focus especially around this golf course is so high and you have to be on for so long that it's definitely different than approaching a regular pga tour event there's definitely more stress with all the people being around and with the emphasis that's placed on this tournament because it's the masters so the week is definitely it's a long week,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-03,2022,42,0,1,1,did you get good parking,no no we used to one of my buddies actually lived across the bridge and kind of up maybe a half mile so we used to park at his house and then walk down or uber down whatever it was no parking,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-03,2022,42,1,0,1,you've got to like the par s today,i wouldn't say i'm in a rush really to do anything out here i'm pretty blessed to be playing out here on the pga tour i'm just enjoying myself out here and trying to do the best i can and to compete,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-03,2022,57,0,1,1,MODERATOR,you know my game feels like it's in a good spot i had some good starts here recently it's good to be back in austin we've got some good friends that live down here and last year was such a dream getting to play in front of all the fans so i'm looking forward to this week,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-03,2022,83,1,0,1,being based in dallas just want to know what you know if anything about southern hills and tulsa and if you plan to go up there maybe for a little recon trip between now and may,so i played southern hills twice in tournament golf or actually three times i played an amateur tournament there i played two big championships there and i haven't played the new course from what i hear it's not drastically different they definitely made some changes and improved the course but it's not a totally different layout i'll definitely make a trip up there before southern hills or before the pga just because it's convenient it's close to home that'll be an easy one,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-03,2022,40,1,0,1,it's a pretty unique you've been up there pretty unique layout the hills and everything is there one type of player you think could be successful at the pga in may,i don't think so i think southern hills is one of those places where when you're playing good golf whether it be you're a short long hitter whoever you are if you're playing good golf you can score out there,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-03,2022,52,0,1,1,MODERATOR,we went out to dinner on sunday briefly and then we drove here so i wouldn't say too many crazy things happened it was a nice dinner and then my grandma lives here my parents are staying with her so we went over there hung out and relaxed yesterday but nothing crazy,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-03,2022,148,0,1,1,you won last week shooting under three weeks before that shooting under is there a different mental preparation for the difference in the courses especially now in florida as opposed to the ones on the west coast,so my first memories really watching him that i can remember is probably the chip in at the masters i think i was maybe at the time i don't really remember much before that the rest of it i kind of have to remember from youtube but he's an inspiration for all of us just the way he plays golf it's pretty ridiculous his statistics and the way he plays and swings it's so radically different from the rest of us how we play golf and approach the game he's obviously accomplished just a ridiculous amount i spent a lot of time on youtube just kind of watching stuff watching his swing and just trying to learn little bits and pieces of what i can from that i mean it's really hard to put into words what he's done for us out here he's totally changed our lives,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-03,2022,176,0,1,1,who do you think is doing better in the pip standings you or your grandma,that's a good question biggest jump as a junior i would say kind of towards the end of my high school career i finally kind of grew into my body i had a huge growth spurt maybe my sophomore year of high school and i didn't really figure out where my arms and the rest of my body were just because i grew and got so much longer and so i'd really say kind of towards my junior senior year i kind of started to feel more consistent and then i had two pretty nice wins one of them being the u s junior where it's a really long week i played against a bunch of really good guys and that's really the first time you're playing in front of television cameras and stuff like that and there's really a ton of pressure and i'd say tournaments like that is kind of where i made a jump from being a good junior player to really believing like it's something that i could do for a living,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-03,2022,108,0,1,1,when did you actually think about not just playing golf competitively well but playing golf for a living,i didn't really expect it to end up in the fairway i figured it was going to either be on the green or greenside bunker or way right in the rough and so where it ended up in the rough to only advance yards i just told myself is not a bad score and that's kind of a comforting feeling on those hard golf courses so from there i was like i can just make here i've got a reachable par coming up it's not that big of a deal and fortunately i made a somehow which was kind of a miracle at that point in the round,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-03,2022,116,0,1,1,i also wanted to see if there's any way you could compare this with phoenix that being your first win but was there any more sense of this being more rewarding given the nature of the test that you had to endure,so my mom worked when i was a kid and my dad stayed home with me and my sisters so i would say a lot of my personality probably comes from my dad my dad is fiercely competitive like i am my parents they made a lot of sacrifices to put me in a position where i'm able to do this for a living and they made a lot of sacrifices when i was a kid my sisters as well they've seen a lot of golf tournaments in their lifetime probably a lot more than they've wanted to i'm very grateful for the sacrifices they made and obviously had such a huge impact on my life,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-03,2022,82,0,1,1,what do you make of this time of the year i mean the season's kind of we have the west coast then it just feels like everything is building toward a big part of the season what is your take on it for a guy who lives minute to minute,this part of the year it starts to get into those bigger events with the players coming up match play the masters we've got a lot of big events coming up this one included it's a good time to be playing golf the weather is good here this time of year so just come over the golf course is in great shape the rough is really healthy we'll have a good test this week next week's obviously a fantastic place as well,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-03,2022,156,0,1,1,scottie as you were chasing that first victory and you'd come close not quite get there come close again come close again what was kind of the mental progression that you were going through at that time was there frustration do you treat it as a learning experience how did you deal with that,i think being close to winning and not winning is extremely frustrating there's really only a couple tournaments where i felt like i really should have won the golf tournament really the ones i can remember off the top of my head is just houston and austin those two are golf tournaments where i felt like i should have won the tournament and didn't so those were extremely frustrating i mean you come out here to play and compete and winning is a lot more fun than finishing second having a couple of those close calls is definitely frustrating it doesn't take me very long to kind of get over things though for me it's just i kind of live week to week those things are frustrating and they motivate you a little bit but overall i just like competing and like to try to come out here and win so for me that's motivation enough,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-03,2022,155,1,0,1,if you go back not so far back as the wyndham cup of course but early in your days on tour was there ever a moment where you felt like you really belonged or did you feel that way as soon as you got your card and got out here,so i was fortunate to play in a few pga tour events before i got out here so it was good for me to kind of know what to expect i think i played a couple u s opens i played maybe the byron once memphis once so i had kind of and then i had one or two starts before i got out here full time so i knew what to expect then getting out here i felt like i belonged pretty quick just because i earned my way out here i wasn't playing on sponsor exemptions i did the korn ferry tour i had a good year on the korn ferry tour and i earned my spot out here so coming out and playing those first few events i remember playing the greenbrier and i think i was in the final group on saturday it felt like where i was supposed to be,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-02,2022,13,1,0,1,i saw you play as a junior in the north dallas area as a longhorn at the university of texas korn ferry amateur events and major championships and now you are a pga tour winner your final thoughts,it feels great i'm very pleased i'm very thankful yeah that's about it,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-02,2022,35,1,0,1,how would you characterize the journey as a six year old starting with randy smith to now at age you're right there and you're now a pga tour winner,it's amazing there's so many people i need to thank right now i'm not going to thank anybody besides my family and randy because i'm going to forget half the people i'm just really thankful,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-01,2022,143,1,0,1,what was the goal and i guess you did didn't have much of an off season but what did you work on if anything on your time off,i mean there was definitely some nerves i pretty much get nervous every time i go out to play golf my thing is if i'm not nervous then something's off looking back on that round other than the start i really played some solid golf i got a few weird breaks here and there and didn't make as many putts as i had in the beginning of that week but i had some experience that fall i had a few top s i think a couple top i think i played the final group at the greenbrier like my first event out so i had experience playing well on the pga tour it's obviously a little different than the other levels of the game but i've always performed well in those moments and for me i'm just looking forward to getting back there,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-01,2022,114,1,0,1,when you played really well here a few years ago that was really i think maybe your first time in contention at a pga tour event what did you take away from that experience what did you feel you did wrong on sunday,i mean he seems to play pretty good every week so kind of makes him a pretty good threat he hits a ton of fairways he plays golf i would say kind of with a lot of authority like he usually really knows exactly what he's doing you very rarely see jon hit a shot that he's not committed to i mean he was playing such good golf last year we played with him saturday at memorial before he tested positive for covid and it was pretty special to watch i mean he had like a six or seven shot lead out there and so you knew some good things were going to come,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-01,2022,3,1,0,1,with phil i think in here he flirted with a and then he won the pga at last year what goes through your head when you think about some of the things he's still able to do in fits and spurts at that age,the courses here,0
scottie scheffler,0,2022-01,2022,169,1,0,1,you say it's still golf and it's still hard but it seems maybe a little less hard here does it affect your mindset coming in knowing that there are s and s to be played out there or is that just what we expect on the pga tour now because we have seen that the last couple of weeks,i mean we can score on all of them i would say stadium obviously is the most challenging to score on i think those other courses maybe you can fake it around a little bit but i played a practice round on the stadium today you got to drive the ball pretty well off the tee out there and still have to get the ball in the fairway and hit good shots especially with the green firmness being up it definitely kind of brings difficulty up a little bit for sure if you play this golf course in soft conditions it doesn't really make a big difference whether or not you're in the fairway or in the rough that's that long but now if the rough's that long indicating it takes spin off the ball and if you're going into a firm green and if the pin is tucked at all it makes it a lot more challenging so you good still got to get the ball in play,0
scottie scheffler,0,2021-10,2021,125,1,0,1,going back to ryder cup i'm sure that was a bucket list item for you to make the team does it feel odd to you to be a ryder cup member when you don't have a win yet on the pga tour kind of a flip flop of bucket list items there,yeah for sure i think for me it was definitely a dream to make that team and now that i've been a part of one team i want to be a part of everyone of them for the rest of my career as far as not winning on tour i think if i wanted to do something to where i could win a random event out here i would go play a week weaker schedule than i do for me i like playing tournaments against the best players in the world and that's what our pga tour's about and so i like competing and i'm not going to change my schedule i'm just going to keep trying to put myself in position to win tournaments,0
scottie scheffler,0,2021-10,2021,166,1,0,1,you've won at every level i know you're going to win at this level what's the fine line of wanting to win badly and kind of being patient to let it happen,so naturally i feel really patient i don't feel like i was saying earlier i don't feel a huge rush that i have to win a golf tournament out here i feel like i'm going to play out here for a long period of time and i enjoy the way my life is now and for me i just want to continue to put myself in position to win tournaments and honestly i think what has probably held me back is not being in a that position enough i feel like i don't focus hard enough on these smaller tournaments on thursday friday and saturday to where i'm locked in the entire week i think i do a better job of that at major championships i feel like i've had more chances to win majors than i have regular pga tour events and so for me i just try to get that focus level from here and take it to there indicating on thursday through sunday,0
scottie scheffler,0,2021-08,2021,142,1,0,1,are you the kind of player who sets goals for yourself like right now do you have a series of goals in mind between now and the end of the year,not really so i try and stay pretty much in the moment it's never really hard for me sorry i will say it again it's hard for me when i start setting goals because i look too much into the future personally i'm more of a procrastinator so if i'm always trying to prepare as hard as i can then it keeps things simple for me so for me simpler thoughts not looking too far into the future has been really good for my career i have dreams and that kind of stuff and that's totally separate i dreamed of playing on the pga tour winning out here doing all the stuff that you want to do but i don't sit down and write down goals it's always in the back of my head i just never really put it on paper,0
scottie scheffler,0,2021-08,2021,108,1,0,1,indiscernible,yeah i mean maybe he text me nice playing or keep it up or something like that a few weeks ago we played together at the pga this year but other than that i haven't spent too much time around him i have spent time around i think the other guys that are helping him out so we'll see i'm not in control of those picks all i can do is try and go out and play good golf i'm sure if the won the next two tournaments on the fedexcup i would probably be on the team so i'm in a position where i can do that,0
scottie scheffler,0,2021-07,2021,56,1,0,1,i know you've been asked this a couple times but when did you start thinking this could be your week for your first pga tour title let alone your first major,i kind of think that going into every tournament i'm always looking to try and win golf tournaments and nice to be able to put myself in a position to win this one we're only halfway there i think i'm four shots back going into the weekend so i got a lot of work to do,0
scottie scheffler,0,2021-03,2021,31,1,0,1,when you can have that experience and enjoy it and come out on top at such a young age wow that will serve you well not just this weekend but for your entire pga career,yeah i'm sure it's good experience getting in here and getting some match play experience in i've learned a lot the first couple days and looked forward to this afternoon's match,0
collin morikawa,0,2024-01,2024,218,0,1,1,you start with wins,percent when i started thinking about it and you drive by on the highway and if i were to talk about it for minutes like i would start getting emotional just because it does mean that much to me i never lived here but my family lived here my grandparents lived here my aunts and my uncles my cousins all grew up here and to know that you have that tie to that family it's heartbreaking you hear about these families like i met chef zach at hua momona farms and he had lost everything and to hear him talk about how he's living out of a suitcase and that's all he's got left it's something that i can't even relate to right but i'm just trying to help out as much as i can to know what he's doing even though he was put in that circumstance of what he's doing for the hundreds and hundreds of families out there that could use his help it's amazing so this week always meant more to me there's only a few weeks out on tour that have that meaning that no one else would know about other than myself but this week no matter what when i look back at my career sentry will always mean that much more,0
collin morikawa,0,2024-01,2024,288,1,0,1,it always comes back to food for us in hawaii so i just want to try to get a little more specifics i read something about how your dad still has a big itch for your grandfather's food from the restaurant and when you came here during the summers was the restaurant still open did you go there or did you have something favorite that your grandparents made and also i haven't read anything i don't know what their names are maybe if you can help me out with that,i'm like right in the middle i'm like if you had a meal and you're like you're full but you know you want something else you want dessert kind of i'm sitting in that like zone look not that i've taken my self out i still listen to all the meetings i read up on everything that's going on but at this point all you can do is just play your best golf and show up and see what happens i hope everything comes together and we're able to all play together at some point in some time in some way but there's so much back and forth the e mails we get is it's all fluff like there's no point in reading these e mails anymore that we get players are saying one thing and then they say something else some other time at this point i think just deals need to be made and we all need to get back to playing golf it is what it is guys make their decision to go one way i've never had an issue with it i've never had an issue with anything everyone makes their own decision but i do miss playing with everyone at one time that's why the majors have been fun over the past year two years not that they're not fun but it's nice to see some of these guys right because it's that was normal when i turned pro i never thought it was going to be anything different not that it takes away from these fields not that it takes a way from the pga tour but there's great players in other parts of the world and i think we miss that,0
collin morikawa,0,2024-01,2024,148,1,0,1,to the business of tour business and kind of where we were a year ago specifically do you feel satisfied or dissatisfied about the amount of information you know about where the tour is heading with this pga tour enterprises thing and do you have a ideal outcome in your own head,yeah make it fun like i think kids now you guys are very lucky because golf's a lot more popular even though it you know comparing to when i grew up i'm only but i grew up playing golf by myself a lot make it as fun as possible hit it as hard as you want go make the weirdest putt possible go try and make a trick shot make it fun because that see it put a smile on your face because it's fun right do that first because when you're able to do that then you're able to be creative when you're able to do that you can go out and play golf any way you want there's no one way to play golf no one should ever tell you that go make it fun in any way possible for how you think golf is fun,0
collin morikawa,0,2023-08,2023,289,1,0,1,i want to talk about your donations that you've been making and what you've established with the initiative with birdies and eagles talk to us about that,yeah last week was for maui united way and this week is for world central kitchen and to be honest i think i might just donate as many birdies and as much money as possible to both at this point olympia fields is a tough golf course so comparing i'll take birdies right now and it would be a pretty good score i think by the end of the week i'm just trying to raise awareness i think we're all seeing what's happening out there bodies are still being found people have lost absolutely everything so anything helps and partnering up with these two charities means the world i've had sponsors u s bank is one of my sponsors matching what i'm doing pga tour sponsors fedex matching what i'm doing this week it's awesome having friends having family help out barstool sports decided to sell tee shirts and all the proceeds are going to go to them so i know i'm going to be buying a whole bunch of those but look i think at the end of the day it's just to gather up as many people as we can and just help out it's a special place i've said it for the past two weeks it's a very special place where we're all able to go it's a privilege for us to go out there and play in hawai'i and that won't be that's not the thought right now obviously it's for everyone just to be able to really survive and stay healthy and get the necessary items whether it's food or clothes or whatever the small things that we all take for granted day in and day out that they probably need at this time,0
collin morikawa,0,2023-08,2023,98,1,0,1,from an awareness standpoint on what's going on in maui and in hawai'i are you hoping that your performance what you're doing what you put on instagram yesterday will put maybe more pga tour golfers' eyes on what's happening out there maybe some of them will donate some things as well,i hope so i mean look it's one of the best places in the world we travel to year in and year out to go to kapalua play golf there hopefully i know i'm going to ask my sponsors i'm going to ask people that i know just to help out anything helps really anything per birdie i make whatever you can afford whatever you want to put in it's a generous donation i'm going to be pushing hard to make those birdies and hopefully everyone else can reach out and help out as much as they can,0
collin morikawa,0,2023-07,2023,242,1,0,1,i believe in your preparations you've also went and took a look at birkdale where of course the open will be going shortly what were your thoughts over there,majors test everything i think if you compare me winning for the first time and wyndham winning for the first time without playing that specific major per se it just comes down to believing in yourself really that's how you get to the top of the level that's how you get to where you want to be whether it's the pga tour or whatever it is that's how you get there you first have to believe in yourself but everything has to go your way the way things line up you have to have that lucky bounce or you have to have that lucky break or the tee shot go your way and you can always kind of pinpoint it to like one or two shots whether it's saturday or sunday coming down things just go your way when you're playing well and you're in contention you get those breaks and it's just being able to pull off the shots when it matters the most i think wyndham what was it saturday on pulled off that shot on the th hole out of the fairway and hit it to feet and made the putt that's the difference of being in that final group and finishing it off like that versus not being in the final group it's a different setting it all has to line up but really just starting to believing in yourself and really knowing that you can do it,0
collin morikawa,0,2023-07,2023,46,0,1,1,you switched things up this year skipping the scottish what was the thinking behind that,i did some buddies some college friends that live in london on sunday played with my agent all three days had my caddie and j j and stephen sweeney my putting coach play on the weekend saturday and sunday so we had a lot of fun,0
collin morikawa,0,2023-06,2023,79,0,1,1,MODERATOR,it does stayed at my parents' house on saturday night every time i come back to la it's my favorite spot in the world it's always going to be home for me no matter where i live no matter where i move to yeah there's just that extra added touch specialness when you're playing at home when you're playing in the state of california for me hopefully put together four really good rounds out here and see what happens,0
collin morikawa,0,2023-06,2023,252,0,1,1,since this event is in southern california do you think he's especially missed not being here,yeah i think he's missed all over the place but i think his presence in the game of golf is always known he's impacted this game in ways that only some of us could dream of and some of us want to do in this game and just impact the lives of many people i think a lot of us here today in the field and a lot of us even in this room owe a lot to tiger why we got involved in the game maybe not the sole reason but for me growing up that's all i cared about it's been amazing to get to know guys like rory and jordan and jt and all these guys but i didn't care about them when i was growing up i really didn't people ask me about the history of rory winning this or rory certain guys winning this i didn't really care i only cared about tiger yeah i think he's always missed but he's always going to impact this game in ways that we can't even describe in ways that we don't even know yeah look i think for him it's just to be healthy at this point who knows when we're going to see him or not i don't think any of us take that for granted anymore but it was amazing at least my first couple years getting to play with him a few times getting some pairings with him that's the coolest thing you can dream of,0
collin morikawa,0,2023-06,2023,171,0,1,1,you said you don't really know anything about the partnership that's been discussed what is the one thing you most want to know,that's hard because i think for a lot of different parties there's a lot of different reasons of why it's happening so we all want to know the why we're so interested in the why for us for me right now it's just like what's going to happen i don't know but we always want to know that why answer like what's the purpose behind it but i think there's so many different parties involved that there's too many answers to really put it into one underlying umbrella of the why because i think what you've seen from the players versus what you've seen from maybe our commissioner versus the board versus yasir versus liv versus there's a lot of parties involved everyone has had a kind of different answer and different reaction to all this so the why is i think that's going to be very opinionated and i don't think we'll ever really get an answer but we don't even know what's going to happen or maybe you do,0
collin morikawa,0,2023-04,2023,286,1,0,1,MODERATOR,i'm very excited i sent him the text and he kind of gave me the i'll get back to you later type of thing max has given me a lot of praise and i'm going to give him a lot of praise right now he was our volunteer assistant coach when i was in college and you don't really do that when you're fighting for your card on the pga tour or you're grinding on the korn ferry i think at the time he had his tour card but you hadn't won yet and you don't really do that not many guys would do that the effort he puts into things that he truly cares about and the people he loves is incredible and people see him on twitter people see him on social media but he truly does care about a lot of people and it's amazing how that comes through it's just hard to find people like that and i'm very lucky to have someone like that as my partner this week his golf speaks wonders he's a six time pga tour winner i was trying to get my sixth before i got to this event so i could somehow get tied you know i'm very lucky to have him as a partner i'm very excited look we're here to win and we're all starting at even par no matter what our past history has been about playing golf like this is a format where anyone could go off one person can go off in best ball alternate shot you've just got to kind of keep it ahead of you and hopefully one of us or both of us really just go lights out,0
collin morikawa,0,2023-03,2023,6,0,1,1,you living in south florida now at all,no i live in las vegas,0
collin morikawa,0,2023-03,2023,192,1,0,1,was it a thrill the first time you saw it because you knew it from tv a little bit,yeah i'm sure whoever has won it whatever position they have been in whether they have won a major or not that's kind of how they might define it so you might hear that whoever wins right how they put it in perspective but there's something special about this week i think not only us as players are we treated even better but you have the caddies our spouses our entire team everyone's treated just on another level that to be honest i think the pga tour should be held responsible and accountable every week we go right i mean we shouldn't have to only have this at one event i think this is very doable in every place we go whether it's in dining or what the caddies get it's very small things but i think that's on the tour to hopefully improve upon but yeah i think when you look at it i mean there is something about this tournament that when guys show up you know everyone's here you know everyone who wants to be the best in the world we're all showing up here this week so yeah,0
collin morikawa,0,2023-01,2023,100,0,1,1,how much does this place feel like home at least a little bit to you with your family's history and everything a fan a few years ago found a matchbook on e bay sent it to me i got it to rolf he got it to you how much does this place feel like home and your connection with the local folks,it's great it definitely feels like home even though i never lived here my dad used to come all the time as a kid and grandparents are from here and great grandparents are from here and there's a long lineage throughout the hawaii islands for us and i would say it's nice to kind of feel that family that ohana spirit around and just have people rooting you on it's always nice i feel that in l a you feel that out here there's not many places that i've lived so it's nice to have that kind of extra support,0
collin morikawa,0,2023-01,2023,179,1,0,1,is there anything nice about having an off season coming up for the first time in your pga tour career,i thought it did before we started the season in the fall but in reality like i still want to play golf i got to focus on this season if i start thinking about the off season i'm going to put the brakes on and we're going to be in august and i'm not going to be in the playoffs i don't want to look at it like that i think in the history of or i look back at golf in general for me to play since i've been a junior you've played all year there's still going to be tournaments to play there's still going to be things you're going to play in but the meaning wise maybe it's a little different maybe it's more like how we looked at in college per se of like you just have this amateur event or you have this fall event everything's meaningful but for me i've just got to focus on kind of now especially where i've kind of put myself so far through the season starting the fall,0
collin morikawa,0,2023-01,2023,134,1,0,1,so is it fair to say you know what you need,yeah i just have answers before when i was putting it was like it was guess work i might have putted well today and then thought i was doing something but in reality it was something else i go back to what i did my putting thought for what i did when i won the pga and it makes sense when i see it in the lab and i see things and when i talk with stephen but what i did was not really the actual cause of why i was putting well i thought it was and it worked for a short period of time but we have seen that consistency and what it was like so we are here to just kind of be a little more consistent on the entire game,0
collin morikawa,0,2022-09,2022,97,0,1,1,where does this fit in you won a major championship this is a special event and you're part of a winning team,yeah i've been out of i haven't won in a while and just to kind of feel those nerves and kind of feel that energy it was so exciting those are the things we live for i think every single one of us here on both teams loves that position that you're in when you're coming down the stretch or you need to make a putt to win a hole it was so good to feel that so you know i'm energized for this coming season and it was nice to get the win for the team,0
collin morikawa,0,2022-09,2022,173,1,0,1,i have a question about the pga k game this is the first time you get to be in a video game i didn't know if you played the old tiger woods games growing up what's that mean to you and is that something as a kid you really thought oh this would be awesome to be,yeah when i got the offer to be in the k i had to say yes you can't say no i think the coolest part of it it's not even playing yourself i think like for my friends it would be cool to play me but i think the coolest part is really putting on the suit and going through the process of what other athletes have done so when you see other athletes like put it on for basketball right they do what they do and then you show up in the game and sometimes it doesn't end up like exactly but putting on the suit and having all the dots and having everything captured like that i think that was the coolest part of like the entire process but obviously the game came out great i was able to see it during east lake when they had their little event there yeah it's an honor it's really cool never would have thought at i'd be in a video game for sure,0
collin morikawa,0,2022-09,2022,192,1,0,1,how does the team country aspect of this tournament kind of affect the emotions and the feeling when you play out there,you know it pushes us i think it pushes us to just be our best anytime you're able to put the red white and blue on we just find that extra little gear that sometimes you're looking for on a thursday or friday or another regular pga tour tournament you just want to do your best and you want to get that point you want to do whatever it takes to get that point that should be the mentality when you're out there playing you should do whatever you can to get that birdie or get that par or whatever it is but now we've got other guys not just the other guys on our team we've got caddies we've got teammates we've got captains we've got family it's not added pressure it's just a bigger team that we represent you want to do everything you can to just represent them well and it just doesn't stop there it goes on to the fans it goes on to everyone else that's watching and rooting for us it's one of the most exciting things you can have and do as a professional golfer,0
collin morikawa,0,2022-09,2022,223,0,1,1,i love hearing how much you guys love this whole team aspect of it but because this is such an individualized sport what's the biggest challenge going from being an individual for so long throughout the year to now doing something where it's all about the team,i think the biggest thing is just really when we're out there like playing different formats that we're not used to at the end of the day i think all of us practice we all play best ball we're always playing at home v matches alternate shot i would say none of us ever play other than when we're here but i would say that's the biggest thing at the end of the day we still need to hit our shots we still need to do what we do to get prepared for a tournament and the captains do a really good job kind of pushing aside as much as they can to make sure we're sticking to our routines that's the biggest thing is we've got our routines down from when we show up on a sunday or a monday at a tournament obviously with team events you have team outings you have team meetings you have dinners all this stuff they do such a good job last year at the ryder cup this year here at the presidents cup stricker and davis love my two captains have done they get a lot of credit for making our lives a lot easier on these weeks and just allowing us to go out and do what we do best and that's play golf,0
collin morikawa,0,2022-09,2022,103,1,1,1,have you ever looked or had conversations about what the best on the pga tour versus the best on liv golf would look like,no to be honest a lot of those guys they've gone and they've made the decision and i really haven't thought about them and there's a couple of the guys that i definitely miss having around but it's a i think it's just like anything in life there's a cycle golf has a long lifespan guys stay for a long time and there's just a cycle of new guys coming in old guys coming out it's a repeating cycle but it's never anything i've really given thought to because i've got a million other things i've got to worry about and my wedding,0
collin morikawa,0,2022-07,2022,48,1,0,1,than everybody else everybody's voice matters but when he's so outspoken,i think you know all the guys that have spoke about the pga tour we've all kind of said what we believe look we all support each other that's the biggest thing is like we're all here to play in the pga tour and do what we do,0
collin morikawa,0,2022-07,2022,10,1,0,1,you show up to work on your links game at the scottish last year then won one at sandwich given the number of pga tour players who were at the renaissance club last week would you expect they have enhanced their chances of winning here,good i mean what do you want me to say,0
collin morikawa,0,2022-07,2022,68,0,1,1,collin you said earlier that perhaps giving the claret jug back could be the spark to sort of free you up i think was the phrase you used are you looking for a spark to get your season to catch light is that what you're looking for right now,we don't need to talk about liv you're not going to learn anything from me what you know is what everyone knows look it's a mouthful we're at the th open at st andrews all the past champions here all the history everything to get to this point you see it on all the boards right i'm going to screw this up does it say it up here,0
collin morikawa,0,2022-07,2022,113,0,1,1,coming here is the th open obviously you're the defending champion what's your assessment of where the game is now particularly with the liv series having started up thank you,everything has led to this that's true of everything but especially for this moment for a lot of guys who haven't been here like myself to come here look out the hotel walk down on sunday when you have the public just walking that's the coolest experience as a fan as a golfer anyone could ask for because it's a game for everyone i think that's what we're trying to do yeah the stretch of just teeing off on just seeing just seeing you feel the history and you feel the importance of everything that has come before us at this golf course and golf in general it's really cool to be here,0
collin morikawa,0,2022-07,2022,146,1,0,1,MODERATOR,it's amazing it's cool to see the two tours come together and make this alliance especially with what jay and keith pelley have reiterated over the past few weeks it's cool seeing me be able to play both the dp world tour and pga tour and see people behind the scenes come together and put everything together to make it hopefully one of the best weeks we see all year i think it's going to be one of the best fields we're going to see other than the majors aside that's what we are here for to play against the best players in the world when you see of the best players in the world that's what gets us excited i know the fans are going to be great they were great last year even in freezing cold so i'm excited for the next two weeks,0
collin morikawa,0,2022-07,2022,131,1,0,1,you just mentioned merging with both tours pga tour and european tour are you able to plan your future event for example coming to europe to play european tour events dp world tour events like you plan to play on pga tour or is it difficult,well you know the past two years i've been a dp world tour member and i have been able to plan out some events to come over here so yeah i don't think anything has changed i think obviously with the future announcements of how the pga tour might kind of roll out and our season turning into possibly a january through august season it could give me some more opportunities to play some other events out here like i have the past few years you know that's what i've been doing i've been planning out my schedule to say i'm going to play this event this event earlier this year i came out and played abu dhabi and dubai i don't see that changing for my reason as of now,0
collin morikawa,0,2022-07,2022,318,1,1,1,before you had your bowl of cereal a fortnight ago put to bed rumours about liv golf how frustrating was that at the time before you took that action and how important is that not to be a distraction leading into next week in particular,yeah i mean it's just funny that you can wake up one day and your life completely change my life didn't change at all i just woke up to people saying i was going somewhere when i obviously wasn't so you had to shut it down i think we all listened to billy horschel and what he said yesterday it is frustrating someone that's years old right i've done this for three years all i've dreamt about is the pga tour winning major playing against the best in the world being here together yeah it's annoying i'm at this point now and it's funny because we go back to my press conference at the u s open and simply because i reiterated what brooks had said that it was frustrating that made it seem as if i was going to liv now if someone says it's frustrating and they compare it to billy horschel does that mean they are all staying on the pga tour it's funny because we all have our opinions right and we all have what we want to say but all want to do is focus on each week and focus on the tournaments so that's why i said it at the u s open because we are here at brookline because there's a lot of history and i don't care about anything else same thing this week i have already shut it own i shouldn't have to worry about it you guys shouldn't have to worry about it let it go you know we are here with an amazing field of the best players in the world that should be a story line and then for next week i could say a mouthful of me being defending champion th open at st andrews tiger woods is playing again i mean does it get better than that it's tough it's tough to beat that,0
collin morikawa,0,2022-07,2022,7,0,1,1,we've heard a lot from liv players particularly about growing the game do you see that as an entry level,are you talking about the slime cup,0
collin morikawa,0,2022-07,2022,273,1,1,1,how bad a look is it for the game that someone like ian poulter ryder cup hero playing here and the comments from billy yesterday,like i said earlier there's of the best players you guys write the stories every one of you guys here right and you guys can write the stories about anyone else we hear a lot of stories about players that are here that come to these press conferences but you guys maybe don't write stories about other people that are interesting every single player out here like billy said every single player every single member on the pga tour and every single member on the dp world tour has a story and sometimes guys don't want to share their story but sometimes they do i think it's your guys' job to go out and find these stories that are interesting that might bring in obviously we are in scotland so you guys might write about scottish players but when we're at other events find things guys might have ties to when it comes to talking about ian poulter i think we have many other stories we can talk about right there's a handful of players that are coming from liv that are playing this week but i don't think that should be our focus i mean i'm sure robert macintyre is going to be a very big story this week but there are a lot of other guys not just ourselves like yes we get a lot of the attention sitting up here playing well in the world but who knows a guy number in the world might not be one of the best stories we've never heard of because he hasn't shared that or had that opportunity to share yeah there's that,0
collin morikawa,0,2022-07,2022,297,1,0,1,when keith pelley and jay monahan announced the strategic alliance between the two tours i don't know how much you know about this but can you tell me what you see as a benefit for a pga tour member about to this new alliance,i think i can talk to this as a dual member right i think we always talk about opportunities right and the more opportunities the better i think if you look at the past and you look at previous players playing on the european tour there was no really direct way to get to the pga tour and if you look at what the dp tour represents i mean i get it we grew up in the us and you sometimes think in a bubble and this is everything right this is what we have right here in the united states and you get a few international players when i first was coming over here and playing what was then the european tour you see the quality of golf and you see the quality of players and i mean i'm not saying you know might not be the depth of what we have on the pga tour but some of the guys up there you say yeah these guys could definitely play on the pga tour but they have kind of been stuck maybe on this one little route on the dp world tour that they just couldn't get out of right and the only other way was to keep winning multiple times get to the top and get to the wgcs which are really no longer a thing other than the match play event and i guess china and then playing in the majors and having to play well there right when you look at this alliance it gives opportunities around the world and i think as the pga tour that's what we want to do we want to have the best players around the world not just the best players out of the united states,0
collin morikawa,0,2022-07,2022,148,1,0,1,so just to follow up basically from a pga tour standpoint only the fact that you'll be able to have better players coming into the tour from all over the world is the benefit or is there another benefit that you can see,i mean i haven't really given it enough thought i mean you know i can't speak on i'm not a i guess we are the pga tour what billy said i am the pga tour look i haven't given it enough thought that's my first initial thought of like we all keep talking about we do want to play against the best players in the world and when you have a field that is able to be put together of the best players in the world we love being there right so if it gives a couple more guys an opportunity to create their name and create their story on going up the world rankings so be it right one i think it reallocates everything at the end of the day i just want to see the best players in the world that's where i want to be,0
collin morikawa,0,2022-07,2022,302,1,0,1,when you were playing college golf the dream was always to get on the pga tour and win titles and hopefully a bit of money too i'm not going to ask you why some others have done that but if you had been in college right now and this kind of a thing came because it wasn't too far back what would you have done would you have sacrificed the pga tour dream something that you grew up with as a kid and through college and say okay i'm getting tons of money there but i'll get to a major i know it a hypothetical question if you were faced with such a dilemma what would you have done,oh man i love hypotheticals laughter don't we all what if this what if that i would have stayed on the pga tour look i can't give you a certain answer but that's my gut answer and that's what i just said right now i went to school for four years and i got my degree not because my parents forced me but because academics were important right i went to u c berkeley one of the best colleges around the world public universities especially and grinded it out wasn't easy got my business degree i lost in a korn ferry playoff between my freshman and sophomore year felt i was good enough after my freshman sophomore year maybe i wasn't tiger jordan spieth these guys that made waves but i feel like my game was good enough and consistent enough to come out here from a very early age because some person did this or some person did that didn't mean i was going to do it like college i had my sights set on the pga tour i had my sights set on my degree and getting it and accomplishing it for myself at the end of the day i wanted to go out there and i was preparing in college to play on the pga tour i get it things can change and i get there are other we'll call it opportunities or other influences out there in the world that give you some other route to go but i think where i was at in college i was going to be financially okay with where i was going to be and shoot i just wanted to win whatever that first tournament was going to be which happened to be you know rbc canadian open that summer so yeah,0
collin morikawa,0,2022-07,2022,223,1,0,1,just on the back of alex's question with your sort of special theme going at the moment how special would it be for a rank and file european tour player to be presented with their pga tour card sunday night,when i won my first event even though i earned my card for the next year the emotions are amazing i think maybe i've read it maybe i've heard it i don't know what everyone's goals are in life right maybe for some european tour players it's to make it to the pga tour the united states is a long ways away i know that from five days ago when sleeping is hard eight hour time difference is not the easiest thing and i get it people have families so for some he know a lot of the younger guys i think would be ecstatic about it some of the other guys maybe they would want to maybe it's a trial period to see what they want to do everyone's got different goals in life everyone's got different priorities i think at the end of the day the pga tour is the pinnacle of golf and it always has been and to know that you have at least gotten there maybe for a dp world tour player to get there knowing that you know at the end of the day when they tell their grand kids i had my card it would be a really cool little piece of history to tell that so i think for anyone it would be very special,0
collin morikawa,0,2022-06,2022,109,1,0,1,do you think it has anything to do possibly with this being a major is there added focus,not necessarily at pga the prep felt really good there was added focus last week i only had a week to practice i didn't tell myself until thursday what i really had to do and what shot shape i was going to play and then i really stuck with it i think this is the first time where i really had to make a decision last minute like that where i told myself in practice what i was going to have to do so far it's just playing golf it's just hitting different shots looking at it a little differently and knowing where your misses are going to be,0
collin morikawa,0,2022-06,2022,3,0,1,1,collin the liv question,here we go,0
collin morikawa,0,2022-06,2022,342,1,1,1,or a liv question yeah here we go i'm sure that you have huge respect for phil as a player have you lost a little bit of respect for him because of what he is doing with liv and all that sort of stuff,no not at all look everyone has their own position to choose what they want you've heard that from multiple guys out here but it doesn't change who i view phil as right this is someone obviously i watched tiger growing up and phil was the guy that was right there he was still an idol for many many kids my age right he is going to continue to be that way look just how we talked about a year ago about people's mental state and not feeling well or not feeling happy we don't know what's going on behind the scenes of people's lives right you guys see us out here and you guys can make assumptions about what we do but in reality you don't know what's going on behind curtains and that's for us to respect the lines of what they want to share and what they don't want to share i think these guys have made their decisions i mean it is upsetting because i mean look i've been out here for three years and i never would have imagined this is what we would have to deal with three years in as being a professional all i dreamt about was playing on the pga tour making putts to win tournaments winning majors and for me it's just how do i get back to focusing on that this has been such a big distraction this has been such a talk where it's enjoyable to talk about it because we all like gossip right we all like the drama at the end of the day that's what it is we're all trying to assume or make assumptions or make guesses about what this or that or who is going or what's going to happen next we know just as much as you we really do i really don't know what's going on behind the scenes but going back to your question as it relates to phil i haven't lost respect because he has done amazing things for this game,0
collin morikawa,0,2022-06,2022,20,0,1,1,liv is not a fantasy we're not making it up that,right but what but what answers would you want out of me i can't tell you anything about it either,0
collin morikawa,0,2022-06,2022,206,0,1,1,i was going to ask you you haven't been one of these guys who has been involved in a lot of these rumors is it still a distraction for you,i think it is i mean i know when the tournament happened for liv and i wake up thursday morning and i'm interested to see what's going to go on yeah it is a distraction and i think i read something or i saw what brooks said earlier today i think he is on to something we're here at major championship and we're here to win the u s open and we're here to play and beat everyone else in this field in this great field that's what it's about i think when you wake up and i'm texting my agent or i'm texting my friend about hey did you hear about this or i'm getting news about this it's fun it's exciting because it is gossip who doesn't like gossip right but it also becomes a distraction and you don't want to be focused on this or that you want to be focused on playing golf i would say over the past six months it has been i'm not going to blame it on any part of my golf game put that aside but it is an extra distraction on thinking about this thinking about that and worrying about who is going to ask what,0
collin morikawa,0,2022-06,2022,255,1,1,1,justin in here yesterday was telling us about actually losing sleep about the big picture of this not the gossip but the big picture as an honors graduate of the nation's eighth ranked business school do you have any fears about the future of the pga tour,yeah wow i mean you really set me up that i have to give a good answer now it's so tough because justin is right we don't want to be worrying about this a year or two years down the road some guys that have resigned i think that have joined liv have fully grasped the idea that they're okay without playing and they're at peace everyone else isn't at peace some guys want to come back some guys maybe want to join we don't we don't want to go and we want it to end there are so many things up in the air that you're not really at peace because you don't know what the world is going to bring you the next day i guess that's life right we really don't know what's going to happen and you're going to wake up hopefully every day very happy and ready to enjoy a new day but with all this going on i think at the end of the day i have to realize and bring my perspective back on what i want to do and that's win golf tournaments win majors and that's why we're here play against the best in the world and win major championships even though it has been a slight distraction i think what i've heard from other guys' press conferences is that it hasn't only been me i think there's a lot of guys and it's a lot of talk and who knew we loved all this drama,0
collin morikawa,0,2022-06,2022,247,1,0,1,collin this championship what is your if you don't mind taking us through your history qualifying wise i know you became exempt once you were a walker cup player from qualifying and you qualified but what's your history what was your and then now you have two major championships where does this one fall in terms of importance both before winning those and now for you,yeah well i suck at qualifying i really do u s juniors never made a u s junior u s am i might have qualified once into a u s am and then i was exempt from my world rankings so really bad at that then the u s open i might have gone three times until i turned pro and i decided i hate california no i'm kidding i love california i just never played well in those events and decided to go to the ohio one three years ago made that the rest is history the u s open has always been important look it's an open it's a major championship it provides a different sense of a field right guys can qualify and that's why it was always exciting even as a year old you're like man maybe i can go play on the u s open all it takes is a few good rounds i think that's what's really cool i think it's always been up there i want to win all four so for me it's not like i put one in front of the other now that i've won the pga i've won the open yeah maybe i would like to win this one maybe a little bit more than the others or the other two that i've won but majors are awesome you only get four a year who's ready to show up and that's what makes them so great,0
collin morikawa,0,2022-05,2022,199,1,0,1,obviously you almost won here two years ago in and then you had two wins i want to say it was the workday and then you had the pga just looking back to that tournament here how much motivation did you find from that almost getting it done here,yeah i'm kind of indifferent i think every week i can't think of a golf course where the next week is exactly the same like for me i'm always like trying to test out the sand just like how we know we're going to play in different grasses i think it's just a sand that none of us have ever seen and it was a lot harder to get a lot more spin you didn't really see the clippy sand shots that some guys can always hit so no i think it played fair like you weren't getting bad lies i wasn't getting bad lies i was getting good lies in the bunkers i've seen places where you see someone after they rake it or even in the morning when they rake it and you're already getting a bad lie maybe that's a little more penal than i think last week last week you got good lies it was just harder to play out of them which in reality it just makes you play to certain parts of the green a little bit more and sometimes you get short sided and it's going to play the penalty it should,0
collin morikawa,0,2022-05,2022,66,1,0,1,do you feel like you're more a feel guy or a mechanical guy,the pressure is always there because this is what we love to do you feel that pressure because you want to win so i wouldn't say there's more i wouldn't say there's less thankfully i've been able to knock off two and not have these questions about when you're going to win one for me it's let's go win another tournament let's go win this pga,0
collin morikawa,0,2022-05,2022,156,1,0,1,this year is kind of a big historic year for majors and maybe tiger woods' history at southern hills in st andrews is that a reference for you and what do you think are his chances to win here this week,a decision everyone has got their choice i heard jt say that last week but at the end of the day you make a decision do you want to do this or do you want to do that i said earlier this year that my heart is with the pga tour and that's where my decision was made i think everyone has that opportunity to make a decision when it comes down to it it's more about where your heart lies you weigh where you are in life what's important what you want to do and you make a decision you do that every single day every second of your life this one has just been blown up way more by the media by everyone else because it is a big decision but that's everyone's choice for me you guys know my decision and that's where i stand just come out here and win the pga,0
collin morikawa,0,2022-05,2022,268,1,0,1,your coach said that even with the heights you've reached you're still always asking questions of other players other people hunting for clues and still doing that i wonder if you could describe sort of the importance of sustaining curiosity,you know i've only done this for three years right or two and a half almost three years we're in may i think i turned pro in june i'm going to call it three years never in my wildest dreams would i have thought what i've done over the first three years is everything i love what i do and i still want to keep getting better but you always dream of the pga tour and you dream of winning majors you dream of becoming no in the world you dream about coming out here i never would have thought about all the nuances and legal stuff and all this other stuff that goes beyond just coming out here and playing golf it's a cool aspect of what i've been able to realize is that obviously there is so much more than just showing up here and playing golf there's a lot that goes on behind the scenes but still three years in i'm learning you're learning and taking in everything just how we're going back to how i'm getting better is i'm taking in so much of the operations and everything that goes within it asking me about this stuff it was a simple answer for me because this is what i wanted to do all my life but a lot of these guys these veterans they've kind of seen what they like and what they don't like and i think i'm just so young and i'm having a great time what's there to complain about when we're out there playing golf and doing what we love,0
collin morikawa,0,2022-05,2022,144,1,1,1,the liv and the saudi league continues to sort of hover over everything that's going on this week and the tour in general when you strip that down that storyline what are you left with what's at the heart of what's happening there do you think,look jay has said what he's said and the pga tour has made its stance i can't speak against that because that's what's out there legally i don't know how everything is going to transpire but it goes back to everyone has got their choice you figure out where you are in life you figure out what you want to do simply on paper there's a lot of money involved right so that money has to be a factor if that's what you're making this decision by yeah if you want to go and play you can go and play no one is holding you back to say no you shouldn't play you have your choice at the end of the day it's your responsibility to make that choice not anyone else's yeah when you think about it that's what it is right there,0
collin morikawa,0,2022-05,2022,1,1,0,1,since you brought up jt and his comments jt seemed to think or say that if you want to go go do you feel that way or do you embrace guys that want to maybe play in an event over there and then play in a pga tour event if they were a member,thanks,0
collin morikawa,0,2022-04,2022,197,0,1,1,no microphone,look i felt like i was just as prepared as i could have been i didn't really reach out to many guys i didn't really reach out to any but i did my prep on what i needed to do during these weeks it's kind of just figuring it out as you go and how mature are you going to be you're living alone you got a friend or you got a girlfriend or a wife with you makes it easier but we're going to places that we've never been to you're staying in hotels that you've never and cities that you've never been and it's all about how comfortable can you get really quickly for me it was like i love traveling i love being around the world and it was easy some people don't get that transition as easy and that's just part of professional golf you have to play around the country you have to play around the world if you can get comfortable with that setting and get comfortable to just the routines monday through wednesday then hopefully by thursday all you have to worry about is just going out and making birdies,0
collin morikawa,0,2022-04,2022,64,1,0,1,no microphone,no i felt it was the chip shot on at pga when i took the lead for the first time that one i walked up to j j and i was like this one's going in and you can't like you can't force yourself to do that you can try and convince yourself but it's a different feeling it's just like a gut feeling,0
collin morikawa,0,2022-04,2022,68,0,1,1,were you in a dorm room do you remember where you were,we had a bunch of guys on the golf team that rented a house and we were right there so i lived with my roommate a block away so we'd go there every day but it was just we set up as many chairs couches everything we had a massive tv i think they bought off i don't know where they bought it but i'm glad it worked,0
collin morikawa,0,2022-03,2022,87,1,0,1,you won the pga championship for your first major i was wondering is there a cracking the code to winning the pga championship and also what do you know about southern hills for the pga here in a month or so,i don't know if there's a code to winning major championships or winning the pga you just have to be ready to go win a major and you have to embrace that you're going to be playing against the best in the world which is what we do every week but on a little bigger stage as it comes to southern hills i know nothing about it i'll show up as any other week show up sunday night practice monday through wednesday and be ready by thursday,0
collin morikawa,0,2022-03,2022,194,1,0,1,MODERATOR,i can't we all i'll say it since day one we all believed in ourselves i go back to that press conference viktor matt and justin at travelers the four of us were sitting together and i said the same thing and i'm going to say the same thing again we just truly believed in ourselves and that's the number one thing is that you absolutely have to trust yourself that you can do it not just make it to the pga tour not just make it to the top top in the world but to be no i think that just shows how good the young guys are coming out how good this kinda young pile is obviously we've seen this young group of jordan spieth and justin thomas and rickie and xander and cantlay like kind of bunch that group together right and i think everyone is kind of bunching us together because we are within a year or two apart but from year one i think it's just all belief knowing that we'd get here even if you had asked us when we were years old it was the same answer,0
collin morikawa,0,2022-03,2022,281,1,0,1,kind of a funky tournament for you last year i think you made the cut on the number shot over on saturday and then under on sunday did something click on saturday night was it a strategy thing where you just felt i'm going to go at pins or what was behind that on sunday,yeah i never thought about it you always hear when you're growing up this is golf's fifth major but you don't understand really what a major even is when you're not a professional when you show up to the rounds of a major championship people breathe differently people are so much more focused and so much they treat it way differently and that's not how i approach it like i show up every week trying to win and i show up to play my best and keep the same routine but you can tell when you step out here like guys are showing up a lot more on a monday guys are showing up a lot earlier on a tuesday there's a lot more people out here because they're putting in that extra little prep because they view this tournament that largely as this big tournament it's the players' tournament and it's for us it's for the pga tour players yeah absolutely the past couple years when you show up you can feel the weight of what the players means to everyone and i think that's the coolest thing i remember showing up to harding park that was my second major and there were no fans and you could still tell that people were walking on ice knowing that this is what this week represents and that's the same thing you feel this week is you see some guys out here you just see more guys slowly taking their deep breaths because they understand what the players means and i think i've understood over the past couple years what it would mean to me hopefully to hoist a trophy one day,0
collin morikawa,0,2022-03,2022,185,1,0,1,going all the way back what's that first memory of winning that you have,yeah i think i briefed that earlier the only memory i really have is tiger making the putt on the back of and that just being played and is still played every single day but no like the landscape of how i viewed the players was like okay everyone says it's big but i don't know how big it is and really all you cared about was okay i wasn't practicing to make my last putt on at the players that's how it was as a kid right because we viewed the majors like i viewed the majors as there were four majors you can say there's this there's that but there's an asterisk right there but since i've turned pro i've viewed it very differently and i appreciate everything that's put into this tournament because it is amazing the scope the landscape of everything out here when we show up it's all for us it's all for the pga tour players and it's really cool to see and it's great to be a part of and that's why you want to win this tournament,0
collin morikawa,0,2022-03,2022,216,1,0,1,obviously you're one of the world premier players do you see yourself as a role model for all youngsters particularly of asian backgrounds and a number of players have foundations like the tiger woods foundation tony has one several of the other guys have one do you see yourself with a foundation and reaching back into the community that gave you what you are today,no it's still important i'm still a member of the dp world tour and i set myself a little back on the two starts i've had so far through the year but there's still the majors there's still a couple events out there that i'm going to add to the schedule yeah look people can complain or not whatever that i played only so many events last year but i played the minimum and i was able to maximize the amount of minimum tournaments i had to play to win the biggest thing is that's how i have to do it if i want to play both tours especially when i want to play on the pga tour i've got to maximize how well i play in the minimum tournaments i play as well is it nice to go over there and play those events absolutely they treat us amazing it's a great time over there it's a great time for me to see the world and to travel and experience a lot of good food but like we said earlier i've played four events this year and this season and i want to start adding a few more and just get into a little more of a rhythm but absolutely it is still a goal,0
collin morikawa,0,2022-01,2022,153,1,0,1,i understand what you say about conditions but is there any knee jerk reaction to change courses like when patrick won the tournament,the answer is not making courses longer just so we can have irons into greens if the greens are soft if there's no wind we can fire at any pin from any distance scores are going to be low it's more about making us play different shots hit it out to the right draw it fade it i think the creativity of golf sometimes on some golf courses it allows players to bomb it right and that's the difference of making a tough course versus an easier course of having a lot of birdies you is see some courses that we have on the pga tour because i know the courses a lot better is that there's some shorter courses but under wins because you have to take irons off the tee you have to draw it around trees you can't hit it over certain areas and it goes back to course setup,0
collin morikawa,0,2022-01,2022,215,0,1,1,can you think of moments in your relatively still short career where you went into a major feeling like you were in a good spot and didn't deliver or times where you weren't quite sure and then played lights out st george's for example,st george's was the open championship was weird because i felt like i was actually playing really well and forget about the scottish because the scottish it was a i was searching for answers right i felt like i was swinging well the u s open was maybe two three weeks before that and i was hitting the ball well i felt great with my clubs and everything felt the same with that prep going up to the scottish but i knew something was off like i knew and we always talk about don't blame it on your equipment don't blame it on this but like i felt that good about my golf game that i knew something with my irons something was just off so i had to go find that answer thankfully i did right so i didn't feel that off once i was able to switch irons once i was able to switch the weight in my putter so i wouldn't say like i felt off before the week i just needed to find that answer once i did on monday it was smooth sailing or not smooth sailing but it was like i was really confident with how the week at least stepping into thursday how it was going to go,0
collin morikawa,0,2021-11,2021,243,1,0,1,you say nothing has changed compared with months ago when you came here but quite a lot has changed in a sense you're a major champion you've got honorary life membership of the european tour how much more equipped do you feel potentially to land the race to dubai do you feel you are this year,i've gotten that question a lot really recently over the last kind of month of how much my life has changed since turning pro and it has but i still feel like i'm the same person i've learned lessons through golf and through the world that's personal to me and that's going to stay in my head but when it comes to trying to win a tour championship win the race to dubai a lot has to go into it i'm not taking this week lightly i've put a lot of work in the last week the past couple days to be ready and to come out here and play as best as i can yes we're at the end of the season we're at the tail end of the season and i made that mistake with how the pga tour and the fedexcup went injuring myself and getting a little unfortunate the way the playoffs worked and i worked so hard through the regular season to put myself in a good spot that i don't want to let this go i think i said this last year you don't know how many chances you're going to get to win a race to dubai and i've been very lucky to play well this year in a major and the wgc to get me in that position but i want to come out here and win if i win it takes care of everything,0
collin morikawa,0,2021-11,2021,205,1,0,1,last year when you were in dubai we spoke about it and you said that you wanted to go around the world playing golf and given the situation that you have right now and that asian tour is not really the focus of or being looked upon as kind of a challenge to both pga tour and european tour and i know you're asian heritage and your asian roots what do you think about that if you're given a chance to go and play in asia would you not take it up,i'm not sure i haven't thought about that it's a great question but it goes back to growing the game it's going to be harder to play on the asian tour there's going to be restrictions i'm not the right person to ask because to be honest i haven't read up too much about it there's guys that are on the pac on the pga tour that will know a lot more about what the actual rules are of trying to apply to go and play and in certain events but that doesn't mean we can't stop growing the game i was in japan a few weeks ago and the fans and the kids out there they love the game so much they don't care who you are yes they know certain players they know the big name players but every player out there was getting an applause every time he'd walk to a tee box so it's just about doing our part going over playing those events and trying to grow the game we play in so many places around the states especially for the pga tour that when you have opportunities to play around the world and it's aligned right it makes sense,0
collin morikawa,0,2021-11,2021,221,1,0,1,just curious you have such incredible equilibrium and balance you've taken your success seemingly from an outside perspective at least in your stride where does that come from you're first major and your second major start you won another major this year you played a starring role in the ryder cup that hasn't thrown you off your very serene course and i'm just wondering does that come from something internally something you do consciously or why do you or where do you think you get that ability from colin,i have great parents they raised me really well i'm very thankful for them i am who i am because of them and look i think since turning pro obviously going through what the world has gone through with covid and everything and not just covid but things that are happening in the states it puts a perspective on life i've been able to meet some players out on the pga tour who i've grown fond of not just for what they do on the golf course but just who they are and you see how they balance life and golf is for a lot of people that's all we do but there's so much more and it's pretty cool that at i'm able to look at this kind of perspective of yeah when i'm here i want to win there's nothing else on my mind i promise you that but when you're away from the golf course i'm able to step away and not just grind and grind every inch of the day or every second of the day because look i love the game and when i'm out there i'm putting my hundred percent effort but i'm able to love other things and enjoy other things in life which has kind of kept that balance so i've been lucky,0
collin morikawa,0,2021-08,2021,240,1,0,1,MODERATOR,obviously it's great to start out no going into the playoffs it means i was doing something right throughout the regular season we had a couple wins a couple top tens overall it feels good my game feels good and i think the way i looked into the playoffs last year i was so focused especially after that pga win let's go win win win and i think i was almost burnt out by the time i got to that third week knowing i'd be here not everyone has the luxury of knowing where they're going to stand coming to the tour championship but i at least know i'm going to be there i'm going to have a chance with four rounds no matter where i stand so i think it's just thinking about how do i rest up how do i feel great about myself body wise by the time i do get there because we do throw in a few three week stretches and it's a long three weeks when you have the playoffs this is everything this is everything wraps up together this is the finals for us i think i'm going to kind of look at this a little differently throughout these next couple weeks leading up to the tour championship and just see if i can plot my way to really peak in that third week rather than burn myself out in the first few,0
collin morikawa,0,2021-08,2021,439,0,1,1,what do you think of matthew wolff's decision to step away from the game earlier this year,it's a very honorable decision i was reading into what matt said yesterday in his press conference and not just him but other athletes around the world in every sport it's a big thing it shouldn't how do i put this it shouldn't be where we are in this world today i don't think it should be that big of a topic because it should already be something that we've been talking about for ages and it's something we haven't talked about which is why it's so important now because this should become a normal thing for people to feel physically injured mentally injured whatever it may be if they don't feel right they should have the right to not be out there they should decide for themselves whether they want to put themselves out there and when they do feel right go out and play and play their respective event it was a very honorable thing and i'm so glad a lot of people are talking about it because we really don't know what people are going through i've touched upon this early on in the year is that you don't know what your friend might be going through you don't know what someone your girlfriend or your boyfriend whoever it may be what they might be going through we can't guess what people are doing and that's the hardest part so i think it's a great topic i think it's something that needs to be pushed and i hope it becomes a normal thing when i look back in ten years that yes people are going to be doing this because it's absolutely fine it's acceptable to do it's something that we as humans are going to live with hopefully i think matt is getting better it was great to see him at the u s open i talked to him a little bit seemed like a completely different person seemed very happy about it and that's how i know matt matt is a very happy kid you know he's a kid so it's good to see him back on track i talked to him yesterday at lunch he seemed very good about himself but that doesn't mean we're not going to all hit blips in our road we're not going to stumble across things that we can't expect it's going to happen to a lot of us and i think by matt especially at such a young age to realize something like that people like naomi osaka and simone biles to step up for younger people i think it's very important hopefully that came off right,0
collin morikawa,0,2021-08,2021,248,1,0,1,when you look back on your two years and three months as a professional golfer and people talk about ups and downs they have during their careers what do you consider to be your struggles that you've had to overcome i can't think of any but that's why i ask i'm curious what you think of some of the tough times,yeah after that pga win last summer didn't really play golf i played golf didn't play great golf i wouldn't call it a struggle for me it's more of a learning experience how do i take that that might have lasted all throughout the fall and hopefully because of that i learned it won't last even a week maybe maybe i can learn from that i wouldn't look at it as a struggle i love to look at them as learning experiences because even during those weeks that i wasn't playing great i might have expected to play better that my standards were higher just because i'd won a pga i look back at that now and i don't look at it as i struggled i look at it as i had a different mental process i was looking at golf a little differently that i shouldn't have and i needed to go back to what i was doing great what i was doing well to play great golf i'm sure there's going to be struggles out there there's going to be tough times but for me since i hope to have a long career and i hope to play this game for a long time i want to look back and realize okay yeah it might have been tough a few events here a few months here and there but how do i learn from that and make sure i don't make that mistake in the future,0
collin morikawa,0,2021-08,2021,201,1,0,1,that makes me curious when you finally had a break at the end of ' which i guess would have been maybe three weeks in december did you find yourself bummed at the way you had finished the year or did you still allow yourself to think about harding park think about muirfield things like that,i rarely go back and think back like oh man i won a major a month ago or i won this tournament whenever i don't really do that i wouldn't say bummed but i was curious on why i had done or i had played like that throughout the fall i sat down with my coach and we kind of reassessed and figured out what are we doing differently they're such small minute things that no one would ever pick up on but it's something that if i sit down with my coach for an hour and really talk through things talk through the process for showing up at events what i'm doing on the golf course we find discrepancies of what i did that fall versus what i might have done the week before the pga and the week of the pga right so these are things that we bring up now to make sure i don't do them and i didn't do them after the open win and thankfully i had that experience i learned from it and we move on there's going to be things that creep up into your head that aren't good and that's just golf,0
collin morikawa,0,2021-08,2021,130,1,0,1,kind of an off the beaten path question here but with the pga tour schedule coming up for next year there's no event in chicago and no event here in new york i know you're a guy who likes to get out there and explore is it kind of a bummer to not have those two big cities do you enjoy coming to the big cities on tour,yeah i love it i'm a city guy at heart and i think obviously i have no sway into going where the tournaments will be but i'm going to miss it every time we've been to chicago every time we've been to new york my girlfriend and i we've always gone into the city we've had some great dinners we've toured around by no means we're locals but we've enjoyed enough of the city where we can go find some hole in the walls or better spots that the tours don't necessarily go but the locals know yeah i'm going to miss it i'm going to miss it for sure and hopefully they make their way back but i'm glad at least l a is still on the market there,0
collin morikawa,0,2021-07,2021,188,1,0,1,MODERATOR,i hope not i think when you make history and i'm years old it's hard to grasp and it's hard to really take it in a quick little side note when phil won the pga i think he's years old right i didn't look at him as this old guy winning i looked at him as competition that could still play really well if he put everything together and he did he could play well and win at years old it's so hard to look back at the two short years that i have been a pro and see what i've done because i want more i enjoy these moments and i love it and i want to teach myself to embrace it a little more maybe spend a few extra days and sit back and drink out of this but i want to yeah i just want more when you're in these moments and you truly love what you do which i love playing golf and competing against these guys these are the best moments ever because the nerves push you to just be a better person,0
collin morikawa,0,2021-07,2021,230,1,0,1,collin well played you've spoken frankly about the importance of the scottish open getting yourself in position last sunday when you're or over after five or six holes did you genuinely feel then that you could become open champion a week later and have do say no to the scottish open for the rest of your life,yeah you try not to listen to everything when you have a rookie or it's your rookie year or it's your debut and if you do you do sometimes it gets to people but i truly believe that what i've done over the past two years every single tournament maybe not the first two but when i heard brooks say at the travelers championship i think which was my third pga tour event as a pro he said he was there to win when he first turned pro he was there to make cuts then he went to top s and top s and top s from that day i just switched to let's go out and win so by the time i was at the pga last year i had already played in these events with all these guys all the big name guys and felt like a normal event i come out this week not worried about playing against everyone else i'm just trying to learn the golf course learning a links style golf course is tough because there's so many slopes and i like to know everything i like to know every little detail possible but it's hard to do that out here so you have to be precise about everything and that's how i looked at it as a challenge and i look forward to it,0
collin morikawa,0,2021-07,2021,208,1,0,1,collin playing with louis both saturday and sunday is there anything you noticed different in his demeanor and his game in the way he played between yesterday and today,there's so many names i'm not going to pinpoint one but to be cemented on the claret jug with countless names countless hall of famers countless people that i've looked up to not just from golf but outside of golf it's so special to be honest i cannot tell you my earliest memory of the open championship i didn't watch a ton of golf growing up i probably watch more golf now than i do because i know a bunch of guys and i want to see them play well it's going to be up there now we only get four majors a year and every single one of them is very special to finally get to play an open championship for the first time and win it it's going to be that much more special i won the pga and then coming back as the defending champ you just have a sense of like you belong this is going to be part of you for the rest of your life the open championship is going to be part of my life the rest of my life no matter what happens to be a part of that history it's awesome to hear champion golfer of the year chills,0
collin morikawa,0,2021-07,2021,152,1,0,1,collin congratulations funny enough you mentioned the pga there that was done with a minimal number of people on site to witness an incredible win now you've got what is also kind of a record in golf maybe if you could contrast that for me but also whether that made it really easier or harder to close this one out if you see what i mean,yeah no i had nothing to prove it's just to you guys i'm just answering it for you guys that we can play in front of fans no i had nothing to prove i had nothing to prove to myself today i knew i've been able to do it i've closed out tournaments before being in the final group being in the final group on a major to tap in like that i have not had that yet in a major at wgc but to have this many people here these are the moments you remember on tv people tapping in for par birdieing whatever it may be to win a tournament to win a major those are the moments the few seconds that you embrace so much you look around every seat is packed everywhere is packed with people that's just what's going through my head of just enjoying those moments,0
collin morikawa,0,2021-07,2021,145,1,0,1,just quickly on that did you have something to prove did you feel you had to prove something that you could do this because clearly you didn't seem like you changed between and the other,yeah this is about the same time that i roughly won the pga going into last season i think i went from the pga straight into playoffs the week after two weeks after and i've got a couple of events before the playoffs i really need to sit down and talk to my coach on how to reassess the entire year i'm not going to throw everything into the trash and just say okay we're a completely different person but goals have to change i didn't do that last year and i think that's why that first week back everything was kind of tail ending i don't want to do that this year i want to finish on a strong note in the season and i'm going to sit down when things slow down hopefully and try and embrace that and figure out what's next,0
collin morikawa,0,2021-07,2021,134,1,0,1,similar question but in a different vein i think you have been in this position before one stroke back today a couple strokes back at the pga and it looks like there is just a half dozen to a dozen players that have a shot of winning this i'm wondering just if this feels any different in terms of how confident you are going into sunday and if you'll be able to draw anything from your pga championship victory,yeah i mean i think the biggest thing i can draw from the pga is just knowing i can get it done but i think confidence just comes from hitting good shots quality shots seeing putts go in there is a lot to draw from especially this week i don't have much experience on links golf and pretty much all the highlights in my head are from this week thankfully there is quite a few hopefully we can just use that momentum from the first three days and just bring it into the last it's going to be a grueling but i look forward to it it's position you want to be in as an athlete golfer you want to be in this position i love it so i really look forward to tomorrow,0
collin morikawa,0,2021-07,2021,125,1,0,1,this is the type of golf it usually takes a little bit of getting used to and guys sometimes take years to figure it out what have you been able to do in two weeks and how did you approach it coming in knowing that it's obviously a lot different than what we have at home,yeah i look at them as obviously they're starred we have four of them a year and you're trying to definitely win these four because they're that big talking about last year's pga i had seen every single guy before i had played with every single guy and that doesn't make anything different it's just the stage that we're on more media more spectators more people around but that's everything outside that i could control for me it's just let's go figure out this golf course monday through wednesday like i have been the past couple years and figure it out on what i need to do to play well this style of golf is very different but last week like i said helped tremendously,0
collin morikawa,0,2021-07,2021,139,0,1,1,you've touched on this in answering questions the question about knowing being a course record here we were getting quite excited about the chance of or what were you thinking about that and secondly have you forgiven the european tour for the prank video last week,yeah i've been biased because i've lived in the u s my entire life and i love the fans out here but i think the fans out here could be even better they cheer for you walking up to the green walking up to the tee box and they truly love golf you can see it they really appreciate a good shot they appreciate when you play smart and you're in the rough and you hit it out they know what tough golf is and this out here can play very tough when you're not in the fairway the fans out here have been amazing like i said from day one they bring kind of that energy that life into what we do and it's really exciting to see them out here and grow as the weekend comes on,0
collin morikawa,0,2021-07,2021,184,1,0,1,collin you won the pga championship in your first start and that was with no fans i'm just wondering how your first open experience is compared to that with the crowds and how you think that might play a factor on the weekend,yeah i would say condition wise it was slightly more favourable today compared to yesterday afternoon i think yesterday was gusting a lot more today had a very constant wind out of the north kind of northeast later as the day went on but yeah out here in links golf you're going to hit bad shots you're going to hit bad approach shots bad tee shots to see the par save on i'm really going to draw on that for the rest of the week because sometimes you have to just bite your tongue play safe and try and make par best you can but sometimes bogey is going to be your friend when you put yourself out of position i put myself out of position quite a few times yesterday early on and somehow i was able to get away with par those pars go a long way you remember those a lot more sometimes than some birdies yeah it's going to be huge kind of momentum and overall through two rounds just stick to the same thing for the next couple days,0
collin morikawa,0,2021-07,2021,152,0,1,1,how many irons did you switch out are they the same brand or the same type you were using last week not brand i didn't mean that but the same type as last week or is it a different version of the taylormade,yeah i think it touched the left edge my caddie and i were a little between just outside left inside the hole i thought it was going to go a little right it just wobbled i thought i hit a really good putt and what i've learned over the past month is to just analyse putts that don't go in the hole what did i do well what did i not do well learn and go on to the next i felt like i hit a good putt hopefully there's some footage that i can just look back and see if i hit a good putt or not but from my perspective i felt like i hit a good putt that's all i can do it just seemed like it wobbled a little bit and you live and you learn you go on to the weekend and hopefully a few more drop,0
collin morikawa,0,2021-06,2021,75,1,0,1,with your prior major experience what do you draw on given that experience to secure a u s open win,yeah i think what happened at pga a year ago is just that i love it i love being in that position to give myself a chance come sunday hopefully i can do that with left but just to know that i love being in that position i'm ready to embrace that so it's not going to be easy but i've given myself at least a chance to hopefully make a run on the weekend,0
collin morikawa,0,2021-06,2021,124,1,0,1,MODERATOR,yeah prep has been great obviously i had a three week stretch of pga colonial and muirfield and the game feels good i love coming into weeks especially a major where you're just kind of ready to play golf and try and figure out the course and how you're going to beat it but this course is tough i've only played here once i played the farmers i didn't play this year and it's going to test every part of your game i think everyone has said that but it's just a course where it's demanding off the tee it's demanding with your approach shots and you've got to hit really good putts especially with poa greens and a lot of slope to them,0
collin morikawa,0,2021-06,2021,175,0,1,1,no microphone,yeah i was fortunate enough to have a bag tag on my bag and he was one of the nationwide children hospital's patients his name was sam and you know it's amazing what they go through what he has gone through but he wrote me a card right before thursday's round and it was in my locker and he told me the motto he kind of lives by i wouldn't quote it exactly is that just people can go do hard things and he's done a lot harder things in his life than i have and i might ever will and that really stuck with me today it's going to stick with me for the rest of my life and this is a hard thing today what happened not just what happened on the last hole but what happened all day just not having my game but you're going to grind things out and you're going to learn from it you're going to live from it and only just become a better person from it,0
collin morikawa,0,2021-06,2021,176,0,1,1,MODERATOR,i hope you don't base my baseball skills off that first pitch because i've never been that nervous in my life i don't know i would say i was better at baseball but like i'm not going to go play baseball with my friends at home you can't go put up a game of guys but when i go home and i a lot of my friends still live in l a we go play pick up games we'll shoot hoops all the time so i love playing basketball but i love following other athletes too it's really cool tapping into their minds on what they do to get into kind of their zone because it's just that's what they're really good at so i love following other sports during covid i was playing with a few other hockey guys in the nhl in vegas so that was really cool but yeah i don't know i would say i was better at baseball but don't watch that pitch again that should have never leaked on espn,0
collin morikawa,0,2021-06,2021,230,1,0,1,that sort of that camaraderie you talk about different athletes and different sports and things how is that maybe love of competition the same regardless of whether you're trying to shoot a basket or hit a home run or have a good drive like how is that the same no matter what sport you're playing,it's been solid i'm not going to want to take away any of those four wins but to be honest i came out to the pga tour knowing that i was ready to play golf and ready to compete and i needed these starts to come out but i wish i was a little more consistent i wish i could have a few more top s i wish i could kind of contend a little more on continuous weeks i've seen my performances after wins and they haven't been great and i got to find the reason why the best players in the world aren't just kind of competing one week out of the year four weeks out of the year they're competing every week they tee it up to be honest like top s or whatever you said they're solid but i want more i want to keep playing well i want to put myself in contention and i really think it's going to come down to me just being an overall better player from tee to green and on the green so there's things i know i need to keep working on and things i want to keep working on and it's fun because that's it's the game we play and it's the sport we play is that there's really no way to perfect it but we're trying,0
collin morikawa,0,2021-05,2021,126,1,0,1,you won the pga at and phil won at what does that say about golf,golf's in a great spot anyone can win anyone can play well i thought about this i thought about phil's win and it's not like i've seen phil's entire career he won his first event years ago i'm now i still consider him as a competitor it's not like he stopped and he's trying to get better he's trying every day to get better it's cool to see someone at like that come out and win because it just gives me hope it gives me just that passion because i love this game because i love this game and want to play as long as i can it's cool to see fun like phil accomplish that feat at a major championship at a great venue really,0
collin morikawa,0,2021-05,2021,135,1,0,1,being back to where we started last year as a new guy full time on the pga tour talk about what it's like and have you gotten a sense of what it's really like because it's been so different from what it usually is,it's very weird and it's all about adjusting and adapting whether we have fans or no fans last year it's all about just kind of finding a rhythm and it's hard to find a rhythm when it changes every week and it's crazy to think you know this is my third pga tour season i'm going to count this as a third season but it's really my first full season where i've played from the entire fall all the way throughout year it's just about figuring out where you're comfortable trying to find those high peaks and trying to stay as consistent as possible throughout year just learning my golf game learning about me and how my body works that's the process of being a professional golfer and it's been really fun to be honest,0
collin morikawa,0,2021-05,2021,132,1,0,1,the organizers are already perhaps pairing you with robert macintyre one of your rivals or colleagues from the walker cup do you keep an eye on those guys and are you impressed with what robert is doing,oh for sure bob's awesome i think whenever you're paired not just the guys that were on my team but those guys on the gb i team back then you're always going to pay attention you want them to succeed because we are all trying to get out to the pga tour we are all trying to be no in the world and win tournaments but what he's been doing in that short amount of time it's awesome it's good to see him out at these majors wgcs and everything because it's just a young guy that i connect with we have memories better memories for the u s team than theirs but it's always going to be with us we are always going to be remembered as the walker cup team,0
collin morikawa,0,2021-05,2021,138,1,0,1,talk about the wind the much anticipated wind reversal seems to have happened how much did it change the golf course for you and what are the leaders going to experience here this afternoon,yeah i really enjoyed it i'm actually glad i played it during the media day because i think i had it the toughest when i played it about a month ago winds were like double the wind speed we're getting now this week i tipped it out as far as i could when i was playing and i was hitting irons into the green and today i think i hit iron and iron tees were up wind wasn't as bad i think overall you could see what kind of scores this brought it didn't really add too much separation there was separation which is good but it showed that really any kind of game out here could play and i think it was an awesome golf course to be out for this week especially for a pga championship,0
collin morikawa,0,2021-05,2021,283,1,0,1,do you think that gives you an advantage considering you are statistically the best iron player on the pga tour do you think that gives you an advantage over the rest of the field,well i think everyone is going to have a long iron in doesn't matter where we play i guess if the tees are moved up you're going to have a little less but what helps me is that i can control my ball flight and i hope i control my ball really well this week and that's what you have to do to have a chance at winning so it doesn't matter and then that's where leading up with my long irons i think that's where it's going to help is that all these guys out here can hit a iron can hit a iron but it's who can control it in the wind who can play it the right direction who can know where they're going to miss it and i think that just shows to my ball striking abilities is that i have control over my ball and some people in the wind who knows what it's going to be like so it obviously takes out another portion of the field because out here with crosswinds with breezes that are going to be into you first two days i think are going to be pretty similar saturday is going to be different sunday is going to be different how do you not get stuck in these practice rounds because i think what we've had monday through today have all been the same we've all had this kind of east wind so how are you going to be able to adjust when the days are a little different with a iron with a iron whatever it may be so when i have a iron in my handy feel comfortable hitting those shots,0
collin morikawa,0,2021-05,2021,200,1,0,1,you talk all the time about process and about the mindset that goes before hitting a good shot and knowing that your coach has all his graduate degrees and he's much more than just a swing coach what percent of the work that you guys do is physical and what percent of it is mental and sort of oriented,yeah i mean talking about what we did the past couple last week when he came down to vegas for a couple days percent is probably process it's crazy i think when you get to this level you see so many guys tinkering and doing this little stuff and sometimes you need it sometimes you're just not hitting it well and you need to figure something out get back to what you used to do but a lot of it has to do with the process normally a lot of things in our swings don't change that much and sometimes they do but a lot has to do with how you step into shots how you look at shots how you're visualizing whatever it may be and everyone is different but everyone has that kind of perfect success ratio of how you step into things how your pre shot routines are i think you get away from that and that's what we work on we work on how do we get to that great zone of what i was like at the pga championship last year and can i bring that every single week not just one week out of,0
collin morikawa,0,2021-05,2021,226,1,0,1,i know you're fairly a bit of a neophyte at least on tour but with regard to defending a championship or a tournament what is the mindset and how much is that ratcheted up in a major championship obviously it's not the same venue and whatnot so there's a uniqueness to that but what is your mindset defending can you describe that role,yeah well this is my first tournament i've ever defended since sunnehanna amateur i haven't defended any of my college events i've never defended any of my pga tour wins i don't really know people came up to me and called me dc and i was like i don't know what that means obviously it means defending champion now but i don't know i don't feel an extra weight i feel like people look at you and they know you won last year but in my sense like i'm coming out here to win and i see these guys every single day and i see them every week that it really doesn't change much like you said we're at a different venue i think if it were at the same exact venue and we were at harding park again i might feel a little different but to be honest i think everyone is coming out here to win and i don't think there's an added pressure i don't think there's an added pressure i need to add to myself because i'm doing all my prep work that i normally would i wouldn't do something different because i'm defending i'm sticking to what i know works and i'm going to do that monday through wednesday and hopefully be ready by thursday and kind of go from there,0
collin morikawa,0,2021-05,2021,306,1,1,1,it feels like it's obviously still so early in your career but it feels like when you've been in contention apart from m you've won you've taken the opportunity do you feel like getting those wins early and not having the scar tissue of a near miss or playing poorly in contention gives you an extra sort of swagger when you do get up there on the top of the board,i mean i do have my scar tissue i missed that putt at colonial when we first came back you know i don't think of it as scar tissue i don't look back at it and cringe i look back at it that i learned and i definitely put that to use when i missed that putt losing at m losing to an eagle you use that as kind of momentum you use that to push you and how do you get better how do you not put yourself in those moments where somebody can beat you how do you try to take advantage of it but some weeks you wake up knowing this could be your event and when you wake up on sundays you're just ready to go play golf the nerves i'm glad i was able to close out the wgc earlier this year because i was able to sleep on a lead and i didn't lose sleep because of it i was just ready to go play golf i think that's the coolest thing that i've kind of come to realize in this early couple years as a pro is that i just love being in these moments nothing is making you nervous from the first day i teed it up at a pga tour event in canada it just felt like i was ready it felt like this was the thing i wanted to do every day when i put myself in those positions i can't tell you why i've been able to close it out a handful of times but i just love being in that position like those nerves that's what we live for i love that adrenaline i know we've talked about it but yeah i love being in that position so why not take advantage of it,0
collin morikawa,0,2021-05,2021,168,1,1,1,rick has a nice role this week with the pga coaching live what's your involvement going to be with that and as someone who's very thoughtful about the swing and your craft do you enjoy sharing that,yeah to be honest i don't know what my involvement is going to be i know he had a couple things to do on the course yesterday while we were out there but just building my swing i think the way we've built it is just how do you tailor to someone's strengths just because i had a bowed wrist when i was younger and i kept that doesn't mean you had to change it and become like someone else we all have different swings out here there's no one swing that you can say this guy looks exactly the same as the other and i think that's what makes every coach out here every player great is because they know what works and what is tailored to certain players you have to have that trust in what they do and we kind of have figured out what we need to do great and what we need to work on and just kind of fine tuned those things,0
collin morikawa,0,2021-04,2021,83,1,0,1,obviously not the round you were looking for but another top finish tell me about this week,yeah a few positives and a lot to work on obviously shooting over in the final round is not going to do it started off great with a birdie but found some little flaws in my game obviously i wasn't hitting the driver well just overall nothing was feeling great when you're trying to win in a final round that's not going to do the job go back to the drawing board enjoy next week and have three weeks off before the pga,0
collin morikawa,0,2021-04,2021,27,1,0,1,some great fan support as well especially with the birdie at that's got to be something that's so great to hear out on the pga tour now,oh i love it i miss it those putts mean a little more you're always going to remember those hopefully we'll have a few more for tomorrow,0
collin morikawa,0,2021-04,2021,39,1,0,1,just a little bit of a random question for you on the pga championship i know you just did the media conference for that on had you tried to drive that green every day and what has happened to the actual driver have you kept it framed it or anything for posterity what has happened to the actual club,yeah unless you really have to or the wind is blowing off your left i try to stick to my strengths and i try to do what i do best and that's really work it from left to right,0
collin morikawa,0,2021-04,2021,204,1,0,1,how much were you thinking i know this got mentioned the other day how much were you thinking about muirfield and having driven the green on at muirfield and then missed the eagle putt how much were you thinking about that walking up to the ball thinking this time i've got to actually convert,you know all the tools we have whether you're in school for one year but i stayed four because it was really important academics were always really important to me so i stayed my four years that probably helped me in these talks with you and everybody else but overall it's just a sense of belief you go through these college programs and you see guys come out of them and have success on the pga tour you realize that they're kind of carving a path for you to do this and we're carving paths for everyone and kids to realize that it's possible for us the young guys coming out we just believe that we can do it guys that are my age that haven't gotten to the pga tour yet they see me they see wolff viktor hovland a bunch of young guys come out and have success like what will zalatoris is doing and they see that this is possible and it's no different than playing golf with your buddies at home it's just on a bigger stage and sometimes you have to get over that hurdle to really just understand that at the end of the day it is golf,0
collin morikawa,0,2021-01,2021,162,0,1,1,MODERATOR,yeah it's huge last fall i didn't really play great golf and i think it really all started when i came back out here for the dp world tour championship and was able to notch a top and realise okay the game is somewhat trending in the right direction had to kind of do a little reset obviously it was a new year set some new goals but i came prepared came ready and i'm starting off the year hopefully on a really strong foot for the rest of the year q just strikes me that you've been to hawaii you're now in the middle east there can be very few individuals in the current climate who have more air miles than you this year i just wonder given the current situation that everyone is living in the challenges of travel and all of that did you have any second thoughts was it a tough decision to make this kind of journey,0
collin morikawa,0,2021-01,2021,219,1,0,1,MODERATOR,yeah i was able to play a practise round with him actually before i won the pga championship i played a practise round with him that week i haven't had a ton of experience and there's many other guys that you can ask that question that would have possibly a better answer but from what i've played in amateur golf walker cup palmer cup to me it comes down to a lot of chemistry you look at the europeans and this is a great example when we were playing at the dp world tour we were all hanging out after obviously socially distant and wearing our masks but everyone was enjoying it everyone is a tight knit group and i think the guys in the us that's a big thing for us is just have good team chemistry and from there we can go out and play our own games q sort of following up on that ryder cup sort of conversation do you sense that you're part of quite a transitional period potentially as far as the american ryder cup team is concerned especially when you consider that there's a three year gap between matches now and that you could be part of a wave that turns that tide that currently has been flowing in the european direction,0
collin morikawa,0,2021-01,2021,165,1,0,1,MODERATOR,you know i've seen the comments i've seen the highlights you know i wouldn't say there's an interest i've grown up watching tiger my entire life and all i could dream about when i was a little kid was to be able to play with him when he's on the pga tour and i've made that dream a reality and i've gotten to know him off the course so for me to have a personal connection aside from golf and actually get to know him and talk to him you know not just about golf but about anything else that's all that matters to me you know we all know the history of what happened facts are facts but for a tiger documentary unless he was going to be the one narrating it i really have no interest q i would have thought because you know him as well as you obviously do that would have made you more interested in watching something like this,0
collin morikawa,0,2021-01,2021,36,0,1,1,MODERATOR,yeah you as well q just bringing it back to this week can you give us your thoughts on the emirates course and its setting and does it live up to expectations from what you've seen,0
collin morikawa,0,2021-01,2021,91,1,0,1,what's next for you and anything you want to improve upon,i'll be playing the omega dubai so it will be that and my next pga tour event to be l a the genesis there's a lot to work on i've still got to work on my woods still got to work on the driver and wood irons have been good but i've got to keep that up the way i'm hitting it now i want to be able to maintain that but that's the thing it's golf i have to remember what i did well this week but just move forward,0
collin morikawa,0,2021-01,2021,96,0,1,1,MODERATOR,i love the hawai'i swing any time i can start in maui come to oahu i'm going to be playing obviously having family out here my entire dad's side it makes things a little more special and makes it feel more like home even though i grew up here never lived here it's all part of it any time you have a tie to location or a golf course whatever it is it just makes you want to kind of win at that location a little more so hopefully we have a good week this week,0
collin morikawa,0,2021-01,2021,184,1,0,1,i don't know if you heard the masters said they are going to have limited fans this year what are your thoughts on that do you find that encouraging or discouraging,yeah i saw that this morning i think it's obviously encouraging you know i think all these tournaments are going to start bringing fans back whether it's limited capacity or a certain amount per day they are going to do it right the pga tour i think they are going to allow it at phoenix we are always going to follow the right rules we built a system pga tour has built a system and i'm sure the masters augusta have built a system or are building a system right now with everyone else to make sure this doesn't get out of hand we've done a really good job since the start of whatever may since we've started and i think the pga tour they need to be given the credit we are the first really big tour to come out here and do this stuff so i think we still need to watch ourselves on what we do and where we're going to be going but for the most part you know slowly to start seeing fans it's going to be really exciting,0
collin morikawa,0,2021-01,2021,128,0,1,1,could you drill down a little bit more on family history in hawai'i for me,yeah so my entire dad's side was born on maui or i think was born an maui we've got you know ten plus cousins and he has a bunch we have so many cousins i lose count so they start in maui they used to have a restaurant called morikawa restaurant that was on front street i had never been to it my dad used to goes a little kid when he would come but my dad was born in california so a lot of our cousins now live on oahu they live on the island where the sony open is we've come a bunch as a little kid never lived here now playing out here you can tell the family ties are just getting stronger and stronger,0
collin morikawa,0,2021-01,2021,286,1,0,1,just a couple of things curious you've had more than a handful of starts now since winning the pga and it's been up and down some of that's obviously just golf curious though how you view that since your win and what you've maybe learned,yeah obviously i wouldn't say golf has been great the tail end of but i think i've kind of turned it around slowly at the end of december when i played on the european tour and that was the last week i just had to reset that's the biggest thing for me setting goals trying to figure out what i need to get better at and really telling myself okay i need to focus on this i need to give myself a few days to really grind and practice i sat down with my coach for a couple days and we had a really good talk about what i need to do and what we need to do better especially after something like that happens i win the pga championship but the year's not over the season wasn't over for me it was just about figuring out what i want to do for the rest of the season obviously winning a major last year was a huge you know check off the box you know put a smile on my face i still wanted more but i thought that good play would just kind of lead over and that's never the case i think any golfer will tell you that that's just never the case on how golf works you guys know that and you have to come every week and every week is a new course and you just have to be prepared and that's what i really didn't do towards the tail end so no matter what happens this year if i play well i've just got to keep resetting and keep focusing on what i want to kind of achieve for the year,0
collin morikawa,0,2021-01,2021,170,1,0,1,you obviously had success at a very young age and we're seeing more and more guys win out here earlier and earlier do you think an amateur could win on the pga tour right now and if so why or why not,they could i can't see why not when i was a senior in college i could have come out here and won the hardest thing is the opportunities on the pga tour we can play any week or any week we want to guys that are amateurs it's not like they can pick a schedule and they can go play events events a year most likely they are going to have one or two starts where they have got to show what they got for a lot of them it's going to be their first time on the pga tour and first time seeing a bunch of guys that they have kind of idolized and that's the same thing we all go through it's just whatever level you can understand that at the end of the day it's just golf who is going to play the best golf for four days i can see it happening it's not easy it's not easy at all that's the simple answer right there,0
collin morikawa,0,2021-01,2021,194,1,0,1,i can't recall off the top of my head the first event you would have played in but i'm curious if you're at all wowed at all being in that environment and if you think that's the case for some guys or if that's less so now,so the first professional event i played was a web com in kansas lost in a playoff but then my first pga tour event was the safeway open and you know of course there's going to be that wow factor did i believe i belonged of course i didn't come there just to enjoy the experience i still wanted to play really well and have a good finish but that week i missed the cut and you learn a lot you learn a lot from missing cuts you learn a lot from those two days of what you did wrong and what you need to do better but i think a lot of guys coming out and seeing young guys like me wolff joaquin niemann schauffele guys that we have grown up watching seeing them play well gives them confidence to play well because that's all in it you see a fellow guy that you've grown up for excuse me you've grown up for ten plus years play well and you know you've beaten them kind of gives them another edge to say ok they can do it i can do it as well,0
collin morikawa,0,2021-01,2021,83,0,1,1,i have to think you're not alone in that if you ask a number of people if they could really remember the last one,it would be really tough you know you go all the way back to players and even then it was kind of a blur because all of that happened within a week and everyone's lives changed within hours that was not our focus on seeing all the fans i remember being out there walking around with a bunch of people out there and that was really cool but to have a memory like that for almost a year now that kind of sucks,0
collin morikawa,0,2020-12,2020,223,1,0,1,MODERATOR,yeah it seems to be the trend that i haven't played a european tour but to be honest i knew at the beginning of the year that i was going to have a good chance to play in all the majors and before covid happened play in the wgcs what the affiliate membership does it gave me a chance to do and obviously with a shortened season everything and winning the pga championship helped a lot and i hope to make it more out here because it is exciting i signed up for membership for next year already because i want to play out here there's a bunch of guys that i've never met i've seen them on tv and i think they are wonderful players and there's a couple guys that i've seen longer than i have on the pga tour i've grown up playing with sam horsfield and sean crocker my entire life so it's good to see a couple guys play really well make it out here like i said we all got here through some different way i'm very thankful for the path that i've taken so far but this week means a lot it's a big week i came here after some good rest after the masters and really prepped fresh mind and look forward to the week,0
collin morikawa,0,2020-12,2020,177,1,0,1,just to briefly follow up on that all things being equal this year would you have played previously on the european tour or regular tour events what was the plan,i am you know i think you guys are very appealing to us i've enjoyed my trip so far and i've only been here for three days hopefully we just keep adding a couple more weeks here and there throughout calendar year whether it's next year or years to come but yeah i am surprised but that shows the greatness of golf out here like i said a couple americans out here but there's a lot of good players and it's cool to see you talk about the pga tour and the european tour the kind of merge i don't know exactly what it was but a week ago they released something about them working together i think that's a phenomenal thing for them to come for the future just to give a pathway i see a lot of these guys and i've met a lot of the european tour players through wgcs and it's been a lot of fun to see them play but hopefully we see them a little more down the road as well,0
collin morikawa,0,2020-12,2020,213,1,0,1,you said this was a late decision can you just talk us through the process and what sort of made you make the decision to come in the end,scrappy hasn't been great for me it comes down a lot to my head the mental side and after the pga i was obviously very tired and very burnt out but i just didn't set new goals i felt like i was almost complacent i felt good after the major win and i think a lot of people are and that doesn't mean like i was okay with it and i was satisfied with one but i was satisfied for at least the next few weeks and that bled into the playoffs for the pga tour bled into the fedexcup playoffs and after that the masters i had i think three weeks off coming up until this week i did a full reset i looked at this as a very big tournament a tournament i really want to win want to win this want to win the race to dubai so i sat myself down with my coach and we talked about goals and we talked about what i need to do to come out here and play really well especially traveling so far halfway across the world and a lot has been put into my game and to kind of my head over the past week to get ready for this week,0
collin morikawa,0,2020-12,2020,290,1,0,1,can i take you back to the question of traveling the world and wanting to become a world player can you explain it any more because a lot of players in america and a lot of americans don't want to become world players what made you determined to become a world player,yeah you know i think if you look not just at the history of golf but you look at some of the best players is that their game travels there's so much focus obviously for myself on the pga tour does your game travel from the west coast to the east coast but i want my game to travel around the world when i'm given opportunities like this to play on the european tour and give myself a chance to win the race to dubai i need to come out here to dubai and feel like i can win not just come out here to europe asia wherever we are and feel like this is a brand new place i want to feel comfortable in the setting and i feel like my head and my game can travel so why not be a world player why not come out here a couple times or whether it's one time three times four times whatever it may be and compete because you guys have great events you have great players and see what it like obviously this is my first one hopefully of many and we'll see what it takes you know me as a person i love to travel and golf aside this is fun for me with all the covid stuff obviously it sucks you're not able to look at what dubai might really look like with people around and everything but trust me i enjoy traveling and people might say that yes i'm and this is a year and a half almost two years of traveling but i love it i love going to new places this is what i want to do for the rest of my life,0
collin morikawa,0,2020-11,2020,123,1,0,1,MODERATOR,yeah it's gotten busier but it's been amazing to be called a major champion by other guys by other people friends whatever it may be it's a good feeling you know why majors are circled in their calendars and why i'm going to circle them in my calendar now it doesn't mean it's going to translate into amazing golf the next week or the month after my results since the pga have been a little struggling but that doesn't mean the golf game and mental side isn't where i want it to be it's an upâ€‘andâ€‘down game golf is but it's a lot of fun a lot of good opportunities come from it and i want to be in that same position again,0
collin morikawa,0,2020-11,2020,223,1,0,1,MODERATOR,yeah i'm pretty detailed in my yardage book as well everyone is different out here on the pga tour but for me coming out here playing the first today is nothing different to figuring out what slopes i need to write down in my yardage book what lines i need to hit you know i think what's cool about golf is that you have to adjust and you know my caddie j j could have had these lines from whatever five years ago three years ago and said this is the line but with wind with rain with where the tees might be it's just about adjusting and figure out what the line might be for that day that's golf you know you just have to adjust so what lines do we need to figure out i think we have that down in one day we figured that out today it's just getting comfortable with what approach shots what shots you might have to hit into the greens what quadrants you might have to hit the greens are tricky you know i think we all know that there's a lot of slope to them and just figuring them out getting comfortable like i said earlier getting comfortable on these greens is going to be a huge part for me feeling ready by thursday,0
collin morikawa,0,2020-11,2020,235,0,1,1,MODERATOR,not really i actually saw mark o'meara last week he lives in vegas and i saw him at the course i practice at and i asked him and he gave me a very basic answer which i love which is control your wedge shots and control your speed and you can say that about any course but at the end of the day how much of a course can you simplify it and i think that's the biggest thing is that some guys might come out here thinking so much about the course when they really haven't played it yet and i didn't put anything in my head of what this hole might be like what this is going to play like i showed up today with a very open mind and see it for what it is i think i got very lucky showing up to the masters in november this year having no fans because i was able to step on to this morning and just go out and play golf i didn't have to look at the fans line the fairways or see the grandstands wherever they might be i saw the course for what it is i think that's going to be really beneficial not just for this year but for years forward yes sight lines might change with grandstands but to see it for what it is very very helpful,0
sergio garcia,1,2024-02,2024,139,0,1,1,MODERATOR,well like you said yeah i've been fortunate to play fairly well here pretty much every time i've played obviously there's some things about the course that i enjoy and i like i'm usually a fairly good wind player and it always blows here so that kind of helps i've had probably about four or five really good chances at winning at liv in the last couple of years and unfortunately a couple of seconds a couple playoff losses and some top s and stuff i've just got to keep giving myself chances i think if my game is on i always have a chance here because i've done well in the past hopefully we can do well as a team and if we all do well individually then we'll be doing well as a team that's the goal,0
sergio garcia,1,2024-02,2024,5,0,1,1,abe you also won the saudi international here in february last year so two wins for you around here is there anything different to expect playing in february rather than october like liv was played last year,when you're it doesn't matter,0
sergio garcia,1,2024-02,2024,89,0,1,1,who do you guys think is the team to beat this year,yeah it's great to hear the news that movistar plus is going to start broadcasting liv i know that the demand for the spanish people like obviously friends of mine that i know and everyone was asking how can we watch it better and stuff like that i think that everyone is super super excited obviously we have a great event in valderrama and to top it off now with movistar broadcasting liv it's going to be great i think that the country is super super excited about it,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-10,2023,166,0,1,1,MODERATOR,i mean the aces are the strongest team on liv they won it last year they've led throughout the year this year but i'm really proud of my team for today and the effort that our guys made down the stretch to win and to finish the matches off i've got a little work to do a lot of work to do on my game overnight but i've got a team that has really made this fun and special and came through today i'm so proud of steeley and camo and riot and these guys that really played some great golf today we're looking forward to playing the best team in the league well consistently the best team in the league and we're looking forward to the opportunity we know it'll be a challenge but we had a lot of fun today we got a lot out of it we're going to try to recover recuperate build on it and put up a good fight tomorrow,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-10,2023,314,1,0,1,MODERATOR,yeah i think that brooks has played some of the best golf of anybody in the world this year he won the pga he played phenomenal in the majors played phenomenal out here just won last week like it's not there's a lot of other guys i would rather be playing against so i've got my work cut out for me but i have the utmost respect for him and any time i have a chance to play with him or against him i enjoy it he is always professional to play with play against and i expect that we are going to have a fun match but there's also a mutual respect between us that i believe we share and i think it's going to be you know very professional and i'm hoping that i can play some of my best golf because i know i need to to just make it competitive now that we know the team matchups we need to reveal the players that will be competing against each other now this is the first time we are going to be hearing of all of this i don't know who is playing against who either captains don't even know who the other captains have selected to play individual matches or the foursomes so this is going to be fun lots of great storylines as a reminder the captains will play each other in the individual match play so it is now time to reveal the individual matches first up stinger versus iron heads obviously we have louis versus kevin the other singles match will be branden grace versus scott vincent and that leaves us for the foursome with deane burmester charl schwartzel sihwan kim and danny lee louis we'll start with you how do you feel about the matchups what was your decision to not put branden in the foursomes,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-10,2023,87,0,1,1,MODERATOR,yeah i mean i don't have anything to say but compliments about brooks and his play and what he's done this year and what he's done for his own game but also for liv golf i'm excited for the opportunity to play against him but like i said there's a lot of other guys i'd rather play against he just won last week and he's played some exceptional golf and i'm going to have to bring out some of my best golf just to make me competitive,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-10,2023,195,1,0,1,did you seriously not know you would win an extra million on sunday and have you got some crap or that since,i guess i don't i'm just bringing like facts to life as to like why that's happening but really we as a group as a league that's trying to grow the game and bring it globally and promote the game throughout the world as well as bring something different than the old stodgy format that we've had for decades we just need to focus on what we are doing and make our product as good as possible as interesting as possible we need to make tweaks into our program the owgr need to obviously make tweaks but we need to tweak our format to continue to evolve and be more interesting and easier to understand we have enough on our plate to make our product more and more exciting and appealing that we shouldn't worry ourselves with what they are doing but i do want to bring to light as to why exactly they are doing what they are doing it's not what they are putting out there on the front page there's a lot more going on behind the scenes as to the importance of us to the getting points to the pga tour,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-10,2023,74,1,1,1,what was your reaction when you found out,i think that the majors need to protect their product and there's probably other ways that they can do that by creating slots if they want to make sure they have the best fields in golf they could create vehicles for players on liv to play in majors where they don't have to use the owgr which would undermine the tv contract and revenue of the pga tour if they gave points to liv,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-10,2023,137,1,0,1,is that a shame as a captain don't you think you should,i wasn't intentionally playing slow i know that in the ' pga final round brooks felt the same way but really all i was trying to do was get a visualization of the shot and get in kind of like my own little bubble and world maybe i was playing slow maybe i wasn't it wasn't my intent my intent was to get into a calm state and have good visualization and play my best golf and unfortunately i lost on the last hole to cam but look i'm going to be trying to do the same thing tomorrow i'm not trying to play slow i'm always saying look go ahead go ahead and hit like i'm not trying to throw you out of your rhythm but i don't want to be taken out of mine either,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-10,2023,75,0,1,1,my question is for phil we saw your reaction last week to the owgr ruling and i just wanted to follow on that to you they did open the door or leave open the possibility that liv could resubmit its bid or its application how do you feel about that do you feel that liv should reapply do you think that they should make the changes that they are sort of hinting at to try to comply whenever that might be,no he's not seen me on a course yet yeah he'll be him and jena are going to come down later in the week i don't think he's going to come to the course but it would be nice to finally i guess get done playing or get done practicing whatever it might be and get to go home and go spend time with him new experience for me so i'm looking forward to it,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-10,2023,57,0,1,1,are following up on what you said earlier you said liv needs to continue to evolve how would you like to see liv evolve now that you've seen it for one full season now,yeah listen i watched chase work over the last year and a half spent more time around him it's been fun for me to see him evolve grow as a person grow as a man i'd take him back in a heartbeat you know he's just got to go out and do play good simple as that,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-10,2023,159,1,0,1,you got cam last year and brooks this year two of the best players out here not the easiest draws you've had for match play cam said last year you had a little gamesmanship in your match and said you designed of took forever out there are you planning on using that again this year against brooks to try and slow him about a little bit,i think he's an incredible talent our team is very invested in his success and we want him to succeed we've enjoyed our time together so he's a great addition to the team and we're going to miss him if he's not on the team because of the many intangibles he brings but the reality is i've been fielding calls as we all have from players that are free agents to pga tour players to dp world tour players that want to come over you know the spot's probably going to be filled by the time the qualifying tournament is here so if i'm just being truthful that's a very real possibility and even if it is filled there's always the possibility of a trade to get him back there's ways this could work out but i think there's a good chance based on the number of calls that we've had that the spot will be filled fairly soon,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-10,2023,104,0,1,1,similar to what phil answered what is your stance on the situation with the world golf ranking points and the future with liv in those points,do i think that no i know that's going to happen when players look at liv they are wanting to be a part of it everybody here is happy and enjoying what we are doing and enjoying the team aspect of it and enjoying each other and the camaraderie and enjoying playing golf globally and all the benefits that come with playing this tour so there's a lot of players that see that and want to be a part of it the question is you know how many spots are available there's a lot more players that want to come than there are spots,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-10,2023,34,0,1,1,my question is for cam brooks phil and kevin na all four of you have teammates that are in the relegation spot there's going to be a promotion event that happens in a few weeks where they have one last chance to get in the top three to earn their spot back to liv golf next year if one of your guys is in one of three spots are you taking them back on your team cam phil kevin and brooks what do you think,there's a lot of players that could be signed not even through the qualifying you know there's spots on teams that are open that players want to come over and be a part of,0
sergio garcia,1,2023-08,2023,152,0,1,1,since you're captain of the fireballs is there anything that surprised you about the whole team dynamic in liv since you've been a member,no i mean obviously week to week to week it's like week after week after week it's not something that we did as golfers obviously we did have that team camaraderie in like ryder cup and maybe when we used to play the dunhill links that was countries against countries but it's nice to have that kind of feeling and like i said earlier the relationships that you build among yourselves it's been great fun it's been good to be a part of it you can't help yourself but think about it and if you're not doing well you're like oh man what can we do to make the team better or perform a little better or something like that you're always trying to do a couple things here and there to create a bigger bond among your players and see if that helps them perform to the best of their abilities,0
sergio garcia,1,2023-08,2023,81,0,1,1,coming off a i think that's your best round in liv do you feel like you're kind of at the same form as you were when you were in singapore,i don't know i've been working hard i feel like i'm starting to get a few things sorted out here and there i still don't feel like i'm firing on all cylinders at all obviously last week i got better as the week went on which was nice and just got to keep building on that momentum but i still feel like i can get much better at least i really think so and hopefully i'll be able to do that,0
sergio garcia,1,2023-08,2023,115,1,1,1,i wanted to ask you about the framework agreement which obviously there's still a lot of details to be hammered out even if it is approved if it gets to that point phil has said that not a single player on liv would want to play on the pga tour do you think that's an accurate assessment of kind of the general sentiment out here,i mean i can't speak for everyone else i do feel like it's the kind of feeling i think that everyone around here is very happy and very comfortable where they are speaking for myself yes like i said i wanted to come here to liv not only because i love the product but because i wanted to play less the possibility of playing pga tour comes i doubt that i would play because i don't want to play more i want to play good quality golf the amount of times that i want to play and be able to spend as much time as i can with family and friends that's my personal feeling,0
sergio garcia,1,2023-08,2023,117,1,1,1,henrik said it sounded like everybody out here was caught off guard just like everybody on the pga tour was i'm curious in the weeks since the announcement have yasir or greg or anybody in liv management addressed what might happen or what has happened in any kind of formal capacity,i mean they've been giving us little updates here and there personally on my side i had the feeling that this was going to take a long time to kind of get arranged and sorted and if it happens or doesn't happen but to kind of get everything done there's a lot of moving parts and it's not going to happen one day to another i wasn't expecting things to happen overnight and obviously it's not but things are fine here things are fine there we just keep moving along and doing our own thing and at the end of the day that's what we love we love playing golf and competing and that's what we're doing,0
sergio garcia,1,2023-08,2023,141,0,1,1,over the last year and a half that you've been with liv how have you seen the tour grow the league grow and what changes would you like to see going forward and what improvements would you like to see made as it continues to improve and develop,i think it's been great i think i said it from the beginning i thought that it was better than expected early on because it's something brand new and you always see little things here and there but obviously liv and everyone around has been working hard to try to make things better and better as we go along they've been able to do that there's still things obviously that we can always improve same thing with our games there's always little things that you can get better at and that happens with everybody that happens with every company i don't think you're always going to reach perfection so that's the beautiful thing about it you can always drive to get better and i think that's what liv is doing i'm happy to see all the improvements that they've been doing,0
sergio garcia,1,2023-08,2023,41,1,1,1,i know you're focusing on what you can control but are there any events you do miss playing when you look back at your career with the dp world tour and the pga tour,i mean there is a couple of courses that i really enjoyed that you kind of miss playing but at the same time we play some really fun amazing courses new courses with liv and there's some new experiences they're good,0
sergio garcia,1,2023-08,2023,156,0,1,1,i just wanted to ask are you surprised at the impact liv golf has had on the entire game because of all the money that poured into liv golf and what has that been like for you to experience,well i'm really happy to see that i really feel like the game has gotten better i feel like the competition has gotten better i think that everyone is taken care of better that's a good thing we always say that competition is good not only in golf but everywhere i think that's what liv brought to golf at the end of the day we want to do what we love which is playing golf and try to grow the game as much as possible it's nice to see like in our tournaments nice to see the average age that you see coming and watching us and stuff it's nice to see those younger people coming and showing up and enjoying the golf and having a good time because at the end of the day you want to keep your game as young as possible because that way your future looks brighter that's a good thing,0
sergio garcia,1,2023-08,2023,90,1,1,1,there has been some controversial back and forth between the pga and liv and one person mentioned earlier phil was saying he doesn't think anybody would want to play over there but does that make for an uncomfortable situation going forward do you see people having trouble to adjusting to a merger,i mean to be totally honest i don't think it should be i think if everyone is coming together i think that people should just move along and get on with it whoever doesn't then it's their problem i'm a big believer in second chances and things like that and i think that at the end of the day if we can all be rowing in the same direction it's much better than if we're rowing in separate directions but unfortunately the world doesn't always work like that i guess,0
sergio garcia,1,2023-06,2023,3,0,1,1,mr gonzález obviously there's been a lot of discussion back and forth about liv and if it's going to survive and not survive as an executive as you are you probably had to bring that all in the fray before you decided to design an agreement what you call a multiyear agreement can you talk about why you decided to make this decision to go along with liv,i think so,0
sergio garcia,1,2023-06,2023,63,0,1,1,sergio after what alex said regarding the multiyear deal and everything with andalucía and the uncertainty with liv are you confident that liv will be here next year in whatever shape or form,yes very confident i mean that's what i can see that's all i can say i think we're in a good spot i think there's a lot of details that are not finalized yet and there's a lot of speculation but i think it's going to be a great deal for everyone and i don't expect us to not be here next year,0
sergio garcia,1,2023-06,2023,9,0,1,1,and the fact that liv have signed a deal like that that obviously must show that there is confidence,definitely i think that says it all thank you,0
sergio garcia,1,2023-06,2023,106,1,1,1,just to follow on that sergio do you have a desire to play on the pga tour in the future,i mean to be totally honest i came to liv because of different reasons but one of them was to be able to play a little bit less obviously that's not going to change if everything goes according to plan like we expect it to be i will not be playing much at all on the pga tour because i don't plan on playing events a year that's not something that is in my mind at the moment obviously as things settle and we know exactly where we all stand then we can make decisions but i wouldn't think so not at the moment i guess,0
sergio garcia,1,2023-05,2023,126,1,0,1,what was last week like for you because obviously you had this long streak of playing the majors was it a bit surreal was it weird how did you feel,no to be totally honest i think that i try to take things the way they are and the way they come obviously i'm not stupid i know at some point i'll start playing less and less majors that was going to happen at some point obviously i would have loved to be there but because of my ranking and there's no other way to qualify for the pga unless you get an invitation i didn't get that i was home i was practicing i knew that i had the u s open qualifier coming so i wanted to be ready for that and spend some time with angela and the kids and then i was able to enjoy watching brooks on sunday it was nice,0
sergio garcia,1,2023-05,2023,105,1,1,1,what does it mean for this tour to have brooks the reigning pga tour champion playing and also bryson and cam top nine as far as momentum going forward not just this week,yeah it's great i think augusta was great even though brooks didn't win but to have three liv players in the top four that was amazing to have another three guys in the top at the pga and one of them winning with brooks i think it shows that we are all putting in a lot of work here that no one gives you anything for free regardless of some of the things they said when we all decided to come and join and support liv we still love the game we care about it and we try to play as well as we can,0
sergio garcia,1,2023-05,2023,15,1,0,1,fair enough when you listen to luke donald and you listen to zach johnson they continue to say that guys on the outside that aren't playing on the dp world tour or on the pga tour have a chance to get into their teams but it sounds like in your conversation it was pretty clear that you had no chance,yeah it didn't sound like it it sounded like my chance was slim to none,0
sergio garcia,1,2023-05,2023,194,0,1,1,when you decided to make the leap to liv did you feel like ryder cup was going to be in jeopardy,i mean i was hoping not you knew that it was a possibility but you were i think we were all thinking and hoping that they would be smart about it and still have options open because at the end of the day i'm still european i'm spanish and i want the european team to win and do the best they can there and have the best chance at winning the ryder cup obviously i was excited about the possibility of playing with jon again and i know that jon was also excited about that possibility too unfortunately it doesn't look like it's going to happen at least for now but it's what it is and you have to move on i can't just be sitting here crying that i'm not going to play the ryder cup it's what it is and i just hope that all of them and obviously i hope that rory recovers because i think the team is going to need him to be percent if they want to have a chance of winning hopefully they'll all get there with the best chance possible and see what we can do,0
sergio garcia,1,2023-05,2023,143,1,1,1,going forward if more liv players win majors what's that going to do to not only the popularity of liv but also maybe putting pressure on the pga to create more crossover down the road is that kind of in the realm of possibility that the more majors you guys pile up it's going to force the pga to make some changes,i have no idea i mean i don't know what the pga tour is thinking i don't belong to that tour so i don't know what they're thinking about and i don't really lose any time thinking about it i think at the end of the day i'm speaking for myself but i think i probably speak for all of us here we love playing golf we love playing majors we all try to do everything we can to play as many as we can and win as many as we can but i don't think we do it thinking oh let's win so let's see what the pga tour does or they do this or they do that no we do it because we love the competition we love trying to win those beautiful tournaments then whatever happens after that it's whatever,0
sergio garcia,1,2023-04,2023,118,0,1,1,MODERATOR,oh i mean obviously some of the memories definitely help but at the end of the day i think that every tournament is a different story the course is playing similar to when we played it here on the singapore open but maybe a little bit longer a couple tees that we didn't use there so it definitely makes a little bit of a difference but obviously you know that if you want to contend on a liv tournament you have to raise your level as much as possible because all of these guys can play can really play the game and obviously it's going to be another hopefully another fun day and a good battle out there,0
sergio garcia,1,2023-04,2023,80,0,1,1,talor i think this is the th time that you've led or co led after a round here at liv with each of those leads are you getting more and more is it a comfort level or what is the experience as you keep stacking those leads,oh yeah for sure obviously that's why we are here that's why we practice at home and work hard to give ourselves chances obviously i've had in the last year here on liv i've probably had two or three decent chances at winning i haven't been able to do it yet but the only thing you can do is keep working hard at it keep putting yourself in this situation like talor said and just wait for the right moment,0
sergio garcia,1,2023-04,2023,5,0,1,1,first win on liv,that was a tough one,0
sergio garcia,1,2023-04,2023,5,0,1,1,sergio i wanted to get your thoughts on the recent arbitration ruling that went not in favor of liv golf,the one with dp world,0
sergio garcia,1,2023-04,2023,177,0,1,1,sergio it's your second year on liv and obviously it's a league that's growing in stature i want to ask where do you see liv in years and what kind of legacy do you want to leave in liv golf,well i mean i love the way i think i speak for everyone i love the way that liv is shaping up and the way that the direction is headed at so we're all super excited about it i think one of the best things about liv is that they're always asking for our input and our advice so that's great at the end of the day we're trying to play as well as we can enjoy our teammates grow the game as much as possible make sure that the average on when it comes on to golf comes down as much as possible because at the end of the day what you want is it's for your sport to be young and obviously all the older people that play it's great but we the most important thing is to have young guys that are going to carry that game for a long time so i think that liv is liv and us obviously we're proving that we can do that and we're very proud of that,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-04,2023,57,0,1,1,brooks you said at the masters recently that your decision to join liv was based around your health condition at the time do you still stand by this decision given how you're enjoying life on liv golf now,i think i think it would have made my decision you can't play what ifs that's the whole thing i was hurt so this is the situation i've been in i don't know could it have been different yeah that's pretty much what i said but like i said at augusta i'm pretty happy with my decision,0
sergio garcia,1,2023-04,2023,70,0,1,1,you've won three professional titles at valderrama before how do you feel returning to a course where you've had lots of success and how does it feel to be competing in spain in front of a home crowd,yeah it's amazing obviously it's a dream come true to be able to go back to spain and take liv golf there and all the teams and to play at my favorite golf course in the world valderrama yeah i've been very lucky to be successful there and i'm super excited to hopefully have another great week there not only for myself but for fireballs gc and see what happens,0
sergio garcia,1,2023-04,2023,57,0,1,1,this is obviously the first liv golf event in spain how do you feel with obviously liv golf expanding into new destinations so it's the first one in singapore this week and bringing the best players in the world to these different parts of the world,i think it's great i think it's something that it's amazing for the game to make it as global as possible that's always the goal that we have make our game as big and as worldwide as you can liv obviously has taken a good opportunity of doing that and they should be very proud of that,0
sergio garcia,1,2023-04,2023,78,0,1,1,spain obviously is big for team sports and obviously a big football nation do you think the team element of liv will be popular there amongst spanish fans,i'm sure i'm sure it will be i think it already is i don't see why that would change at all i think that we all love team events and team competition and i think i'm a huge sports for me so for me it's always easier to relate to a team even though you have your two or three different favorite players you always relate to a team much easier than you would relate to an individual,0
sergio garcia,1,2023-04,2023,80,1,1,1,cam said yesterday in his press conference cam smith that maybe some of the liv guys might feel like they have something more to prove this week because some people think that you guys stink and all this stuff do you feel that way that maybe you got a little bit more to prove from people who are kind of counting you guys out before you even get started,i did shower this morning so obviously it was a little humid out there laughter no i think at the end of the day we're all here we're all trying to compete we're going to give it our best it doesn't matter if you're a pga tour player or liv golf player i think at the end of the day we're all going to give it our best shot and we'll see what happens at the end of the week,0
sergio garcia,1,2023-04,2023,19,0,1,1,one of his points was he thought it would be good for liv if someone was not just contending but won do you agree with that,of course if anybody does well it's good it's as simple as that there's no second thoughts for sure,0
sergio garcia,1,2023-04,2023,18,0,1,1,i don't know if you're aware the times reported that the arbitrator ruled against the liv tour,i haven't heard i haven't been a part of it i tried to stay away from all that,0
sergio garcia,1,2023-03,2023,132,0,1,1,my question is really for all four of you when you play individual and sergio you alluded to it a little bit when you weren't going to be a factor for the winning title but you said you still had to keep your head in the game because there's a team aspect what does it mean it seems like if you're playing out here on the liv golf league literally every shot counts all the way to the end could you guys touch on that a little bit that even if you're out of it on the individual title you still got to hang in there for your brothers,yeah definitely i think that's an aspect that you can't get anywhere else i think that you're playing individually but you know that you're also helping your teammates and you can't like for example for me today even though i was struggling and mentally it wasn't easy i was still fighting as hard as i could to make sure to not let my round go away get away from me because if one of them struggles then the whole team struggles you try to find whatever you have inside of you to make sure that you don't let the round get away from you because you know that at the end of the day a couple of shots here and there might be the difference between winning or losing as a team,0
sergio garcia,1,2023-03,2023,90,0,1,1,abe was in here yesterday and he was talking about how much support that he got from the community around here obviously you got a lot of support in mayakoba do you feel it's somewhat similar to mayakoba in terms of the support the fireballs are getting,yes maybe not quite to the same level because obviously we're playing in mexico and two mexicans in my team but yeah i definitely feel like there's also a lot of latinos not only the american crowd but there's also a lot of latinos here pushing for us and then cheering us on it's been great but it's been great everywhere so we're super happy and super excited about what liv is doing and the crowds that we're getting and everything so we're just enjoying it as much as possible,0
sergio garcia,1,2023-03,2023,98,1,1,1,and also with the recent changes that the pga has made the only way they wouldn't be able to see is if they were blind they're obviously copying most of the stuff they're doing here at liv golf do you think a bunch of the younger guys on tour that don't make the elevated events will be trying to flock over here every chance that they get here in the near future,i don't know it's a good question i guess we'll wait and see but not anybody can get in here you have to be a great player and a big supporter and believe in what's going on here i'm not going to lie i'm happy about what's happening on the pga tour because i have a lot of friends there and they deserve to get everything that they're getting and i'm happy for them the same way that they're happy that i'm here and doing what we're doing so i guess we'll see what happens in the future,0
sergio garcia,1,2023-03,2023,134,0,1,1,i just wanted to ask about your relationship with fans watching you from tiger chasing it and then it felt like it sort of flipped at some point where the fans maybe were sergio guys maybe they weren't i'm just kind of curious what your relationship is like with fans today and if the liv tour has changed that for you if you see a difference,i've always said it i've always felt very lucky about the fan base that i have and the support i have gotten from the fans obviously not every fan is going to cheer for me and i know that when you're playing against the greatest player ever obviously he's got a lot of fans so obviously when i'm playing against him or when i was playing against him his fans wouldn't cheer for me but i'm pretty sure that when i wasn't playing against him some of his fans were probably cheering for me at the end of the day like i said i'm super happy about the support i get everywhere in the world not only here in the u s and i can't thank the crowds enough for cheering on for me,0
sergio garcia,1,2023-03,2023,66,1,0,1,you talked about the guys on the pga tour in a few more weeks there will be a dinner what kind of do you expect do you think it might be i know guys are still friends but could there be some awkwardness,i don't know you'll have to ask whoever is going to feel awkward i'm going to feel fine i don't have any problems with anyone and i try not to make a big deal out of it i'm going to be there because i earned it because i deserve it and i'm going to enjoy it i hope the rest of the guys do the same,0
sergio garcia,1,2023-02,2023,67,0,1,1,MODERATOR,not quite i think we played maybe once or twice played with abraham but got to see carlos a little bit in florida when we went to do the shoot for liv and obviously saw all of them at our charity event in austin so that was really nice we kept in touch obviously checking on each other and making sure that everyone is in good shape,0
sergio garcia,1,2023-02,2023,108,0,1,1,a bit of a different logo a couple of changes what do you guys think compared to last year's,yeah we worked on it obviously with liv and their production team we're really happy i think that i mean we like the logo from last year but i think this is like talking to friends of mine and businessmen and stuff they've all told me this logo they feel like it's a logo more people can wear the other one was nice but it was probably a little bit more kid related a little bit too young maybe so that's a good feedback to have from businessmen that have done great things in their where they work and everything so we're obviously happy to hear those things,0
sergio garcia,1,2022-10,2022,57,0,1,1,sergio with your knee injury is that looking like an operation or anything serious like that,i don't know as of now it doesn't look like it but we'll see at the end of the day i want to play where people want me where people are excited to have me and where i feel like i'm welcome and loved right now that's here that's at liv and i'm very excited about that,0
sergio garcia,1,2022-10,2022,178,0,1,1,sergio i was hoping to get your perspective on this when a young player today turns pro out of college or even in your case as a teenager there's sort of this trepidation because there's the financial commitment you have to pay your own way obviously this is a different path now that's available he was able to come out here with a little bit of a base and maybe not so much pressure i'm wondering if you see this as a path for younger players to be able to get some experience and play without worrying about the money,great question i definitely agree with you i think this is a great path you know for me i was fortunate because i had a really good amateur career and i had a couple decent contracts when i came out but still you have to perform every single week and if you don't look what happened to justin rose unbelievable player obviously but you get in a slump and you miss cuts and you don't know what you're going to do to be able to come out here with good talent and for them to be able to play a little bit more freely and show what they can really do without having to be super intense on if i don't make the cut this week what am i going to do and am i going to be able to play the next three weeks or something like that i think it's huge liv golf has given us that chance and super proud that we have one of them in our team and already a winner it's amazing,0
sergio garcia,1,2022-10,2022,133,0,1,1,sergio yesterday we spoke about your success here in thailand another victory for you here congratulations with liv golf right now do you feel that your win would inspire an idea for you to perhaps think about growing the game through liv golf here in asia because you have a lot of following and you see a lot of kids still looking up to you and also seeing eugenio's performance today they're very very inspired about the victory and having liv here in asia,yeah obviously liv has given us the possibility of coming here to thailand and asia and trying to develop the game even more it's nice to be able to do it i think starting next year we're going to be coming to a couple different this is a global tour it's not a tour that is in the u s not a tour that is in europe this is a global tour i think i speak for everyone it's great for us we feel very proud and very thankful to liv to put their belief on us to try to bring the game of golf everywhere in the world and make it grow and to see all those kids out there supporting us and enjoying it it's what we always try to do,0
sergio garcia,1,2022-10,2022,94,0,1,1,sergio you always seem to enjoy yourself when you come to thailand i saw you winning the thailand golf championship what is it about thailand that you really enjoy and how do you feel about the prospect of your team winning the liv team competition here in thailand,yeah obviously i always have a great time here in thailand been successful so it's always fun to come back and see familiar faces the thai people are always very very polite and very supportive i wish physically i was a little bit better obviously i'm struggling a little bit with my left knee but i'm giving it everything i have trying to help my teammates they're obviously playing amazing and very very proud of them we need one more good day tomorrow and it would be nice to get there on that podium,0
sergio garcia,1,2022-07,2022,18,0,1,1,d j is up there you played well today lee's up there ian's up there what does it say about liv golf,great i hope we do really really well if we do well it helps all of us there,0
sergio garcia,1,2022-07,2022,3,0,1,1,since you've signed on with liv how has your life been,great much better,0
sergio garcia,1,2022-06,2022,96,1,0,1,MODERATOR,well i mean similar for me i think yes we could have they could have communicated better with us and come to i think we could have all come to an agreement if they really wanted i've played both the pga tour and the european tour for years so obviously i've been very faithful to both of them and it is a little bit disappointing the way they've kind of turned around but at the same time we're doing what we think is best for the game for ourselves for our families and that's our decision,1
sergio garcia,1,2022-06,2022,179,0,1,1,MODERATOR,yeah i guess there was you never knew how everyone was going to act obviously you were hoping that it wouldn't change we still hope that it won't affect it i think at the end of the day like i said i did this for several reasons i did it because i think this is the future of golf because i think that this is a great opportunity not only to do what i love which is playing golf but at the same time be able to spend more time with my family and watch them grow i have a four year old and a two year old so it's nice to watch them grow as much as possible i've been doing this for years so traveling a lot and stuff and make a great living out of it i hope that i still have the possibility as i'm sure they do too to be a part of a few more ryder cup teams but that's not going to depend on us now we'll just keep our fingers crossed,1
sergio garcia,1,2022-06,2022,99,0,1,1,all three of you spoke about team golf and all three of you have very rich histories in the ryder cup i'm wondering if you knew whether this decision would jeopardize you guys' ryder cup futures and if you did know why was it worth it for you to jeopardize that to come play liv golf,without a doubt yeah like i was mentioning earlier i think we play a very individual sport throughout our whole lives and now we have the possibility of making it a little bit more of like a little group like a little family and you definitely build stronger relationships through that i said it when it comes down to ryder cups probably my best friendships on tour have come out in ryder cups through ryder cups this is a little bit different format but it's a similar feeling and you can definitely build some amazing relationships for the future,1
sergio garcia,1,2022-06,2022,94,1,0,1,as far as the european tour i'm sure you guys saw yesterday to the changes to the pga tour structure and sort of a strengthening of the strategic alliance as guys who played on the pga tour and came up on the european tour what was your reaction seeing the pga tour and the european tour make all these changes so quickly and kind of lean into one another,you know it's their opinion i mean i don't know exactly what they said but at the end of the day for us i can tell you that when we're out there we're competing and we're trying our hardest everyone is it's not easy you know that's what they might think but we are here trying to hit the right shots and good shots and like i said earlier you also feel a little bit of extra pressure performing for your teammates we're working hard on it and that's the way we see it,1
sergio garcia,1,2022-06,2022,109,0,1,1,will you be doing anything different from ian,i mean they're not that different from a lot of the tournaments we play i mean don't get me wrong liv is not riding us until we can't walk we don't have those many things to do but at the same thing the events they put on they're fun events they're nice to go to they're very easygoing a lot of good energy around them it's easy to do them obviously personally i've enjoyed them the ones in london and the ones here so far i've enjoyed them very much and i'm very happy with the way they're managing our time and everything they want to achieve with it,1
sergio garcia,1,2022-06,2022,10,1,1,1,after speaking to one of the players who is actually supposedly waitlisted for liv golf and he's one of about players from the pga tour who's waitlisted for getting into liv golf which shows the success of the format and the tour so far but one of the things that he was talking to me about was the fact about loneliness at the elite level of golf and that being everyone talks about money and other things but he said that loneliness on the pga tour at the elite level is actually one of the biggest reasons why i want to come to liv golf from what i've heard of what has happened in london i wanted to get your thoughts and opinions on that,some of them are probably even less i would say,1
sergio garcia,1,2022-06,2022,25,1,1,1,it's obviously a bit of a different model in the sense of you guys have contracts with liv golf as opposed to being independent contractors on the other tours i saw the pictures from the party last night how are the asks different on a liv golf tournament week as far as what you guys have to do obligations compared to a pga tour or european tour week,for me personally i'm happy for the guys on the pga tour i'm happy that they can enjoy that i'll just say it that way,1
sergio garcia,1,2022-06,2022,24,1,0,1,a statement today from pga tour commissioner jay monahan he's gone with the strongest possible sanctions do you think that's the right approach,well i can't speak for him obviously i'm not a member of the pga tour i resigned about a week and a half ago,1
sergio garcia,1,2022-06,2022,71,1,0,1,not according to jay monahan,well he received my letter that's up to him it doesn't bother me i'm very happy where i am and i'm excited i'm excited for this tour i thought that today was a great day to start and that's what i'm going to focus like i said i resigned a week and a half ago so whatever the pga tour says doesn't doesn't go with me because i'm not a member,1
sergio garcia,1,2022-06,2022,107,0,1,1,any golfer can play where they want to,yeah that's one of the reasons why i resigned because i didn't want to get into my legal battles i'm very happy to be here for many reasons it's going to allow me to do what i love which is playing golf it's going to allow me to see my family more spend more time with my kids and spend as much time as i can and i make a good living doing it for me it's a win win i'm excited for what's coming excited to finally be here playing and see the reaction of the people and the players and everything so it's very exciting,1
sergio garcia,1,2022-06,2022,48,0,1,1,how is your season panning out now how many events do you see yourself playing all eight year and what else are you doing majors,yeah obviously majors you know if nothing happens hopefully a couple european tour events here and there i would love to do that and keep my membership there and obviously the liv events and just enjoy time with the family and watch them grow and play with them,1
sergio garcia,1,2022-06,2022,9,1,1,1,what do you think about the liv statement that the pga tour are being vindictive,i'm not going to go that way out there,1
sergio garcia,1,2022-06,2022,76,0,1,1,in terms of how this looks for the sport this kind of power struggle that seems to be going on do you think it's sad seeing this in fighting,yeah it would be nice for everyone to get along but unfortunately some don't want to and we've got to live with that but like i said i'm focused on where i am and i'm very happy with my decision you know we are going to enjoy it as much as we can we're going to play as hard as we can and help grow the game and you know that's one of the main goals,1
sergio garcia,1,2022-06,2022,124,1,0,1,will you still take part in the ryder cup,definitely first of all i'm european i love the european tour i played it for years even though i played on the pga tour i always made sure that i kept my membership in europe because i love the european tour and that's one of the reasons why i wanted to stay a member of the european tour and obviously we're going to have to wait and see what the european tour does but i definitely would like to keep my membership there play at least my minimum and you know get my as good a chance as i can to make the ryder cup team because i love that event but i guess we'll see we'll wait and see what happens over there,1
sergio garcia,1,2022-06,2022,118,1,0,1,what happened with the pga tour is this what you saw coming,yeah mainly because i don't want to get any legal battles with anyone i think on my perspective i don't think that's good energy for anyone and you know i don't want to do that so you know trying to get anything from it doesn't help me or doesn't bother me so i'd rather and also to be totally honest i wasn't going to be able to play anyway so i was never going to be able to be a member so no matter what i did because i'm doing this to play less so i can be more with my family not to play more no matter what it was a no deal for me no brainer,1
sergio garcia,1,2022-01,2022,2,1,0,1,saudi next week you're playing again just as a member of presumably both the pga tour and dp world tour did you have to get a release to play from both or just one,from both,0
sergio garcia,1,2022-01,2022,25,1,0,1,and what do you think of the european tour haven't given any conditions but what do you think of the conditions that the pga tour attached in that you need to go play pebble beach sometime over the next couple of seasons,we'll obviously do the best thing for us and for the tour and we'll try to help each other and it will all be fine,0
sergio garcia,1,2021-08,2021,140,1,0,1,do you think it's possible at this time of year and considering the region that we play the playoffs in to have firm courses to have a test that's anything more than where guys are going to throw a lot of birdies on the birdie,yes it definitely would be nice i remember for example when i almost won the fedexcup i remember when we played in new jersey i can't remember i can't recall the name of the course but it played firm it was like an old traditional kind of course small greens and it played tough i remember i was playing really well and three of us went to a playoff with not too many under yeah you probably don't get me wrong probably the pga tour wants them to be a little bit like that they probably don't want as many under par in the playoffs but sometimes you can't control it i guess you can only get the course as firm as they can but at the end of the day everyone is just much better than they ever were,0
sergio garcia,1,2021-08,2021,104,1,0,1,paddy said today to some reporters overseas about how he wants all prospective captains' picks to play the bmw pga are you planning on going across the atlantic to play in that and if not what was the decision behind that,at the moment i don't have it planned i think that i don't know it's obviously you know i'm not going to lie i'm years old i've traveled all around the world for a long time so i can't be doing too many jumps and just close to the ryder cup if i get picked obviously i'll talk to him and if he has me in his sights to be in the team try to figure out what we can do but what i want to do is play as well as i can this week and hopefully next week and then we'll see,0
sergio garcia,1,2021-05,2021,122,1,0,1,it seems like guys that have done well here in the past like yourself like phil justin rose you do well again is there something to cracking the colonial code how to play well here once you've played well here before you have an idea how to play well here,i don't know i think it just depends on how you're feeling that week and how the game is how your game is obviously i was thankful enough and lucky enough to get my first pga tour win here in and i've had some really good weeks and i've also had some not so great weeks it's been a little bit of black and white for me on this course but i do like the course and i feel like if my game is on if i drive the ball well i can score very nicely here but like i said earlier colonial is really asking a lot off the tee and if you're a little bit off you're going to struggle,0
sergio garcia,1,2021-05,2021,99,1,0,1,years ago you won here and i'm wondering it's a special anniversary years years was that in your mind at all entering the week,well i mean i obviously knew that i won here in because it was my first pga tour win but no i didn't think that it was my year anniversary i didn't even think about that now that you mention it but it's nice it's nice to go through those milestones i guess and it just shows me how long i've been out here and how fortunate i've been to be consistent throughout my career touch wood but obviously quite healthy all those things i'm very proud to be a part of i'm just excited to keep it going,0
sergio garcia,1,2021-03,2021,53,0,1,1,do you feel like this is a spanish home game for you you live in the area now with you and your family,when we are here in the united states but obviously yeah it is fun it is fun to be around with some of the people we have met here that were able to come and it's a great town so you know hopefully they're going to see me for a long time now,0
sergio garcia,1,2021-03,2021,72,0,1,1,obviously living here now and feel the hometown crowd kind of coming out and supporting you out here today,yeah i've always felt like i've gotten great support all over the world and all around the country i definitely feel it a little bit more here now that we're spending a little bit more time made a lot of good friends here in austin it's an awesome city really really enjoy our time here and it's nice to go out there and play well not only for me but for them,0
sergio garcia,1,2021-01,2021,166,0,1,1,MODERATOR,it is a big challenge much bigger than much bigger than in the past for several reasons first of all because i'm not getting any younger and the body feels it but second of all because of the times we live in and how the regulations the rules and regulations are different in every country you go it definitely comes into effect and hopefully it won't change my schedule too much throughout year but it might you know if countries come up with new rules and stuff like that and quarantines and stuff like that it might be difficult for me to travel to some of the places and have enough time to get ready for those tournaments as the year goes by we'll try to adjust the best way possible q is that sort of sense of uncertainty and the fact that whatever comes on the news bulletin could have a direct effect on your job immediately is that a stressful situation at the moment,0
sergio garcia,1,2021-01,2021,157,0,1,1,MODERATOR,i try not to stress too much because at the end of the day we are still very lucky we have a job we do what we love and we still live a great life but it's definitely i would say uncomfortable because it's just so difficult to make plans right now for the past year it's pretty much impossible to make plans because you don't know what you need going into some places and things might change midway there so that's the only thing that is a little bit annoying but you know the silver lining i guess is it's not too bad at the end of the day q and just a final thought obviously you're based in america what's the situation as far as you players are concerned in terms of where you sit in a queue for a vaccine and obviously that sort of thing that's obviously seemingly the way out of things,0
dustin johnson,1,2024-03,2024,124,0,1,1,with your recent win at liv golf las vegas you're currently second in the individual standings heading into this week do you make any changes to your game coming into a course like this that's maybe a bit different to what you're normally used to,no i won't change anything obviously just trying to get more familiar with the course but i feel like the game is in really good form last week i played way better than what my score was and where i finished i was really happy with the way i played i had a tough time on the greens some guys a lot of guys struggled it's just they're really difficult to read i like these greens they fit my eye i feel like i'm rolling it really well i'm excited for the week i feel like the game is in really good form and even last week the result wasn't good but i feel like i played way better than what my result was,0
dustin johnson,1,2024-02,2024,49,0,1,1,how are you going to celebrate tonight,i have no idea probably not too much i'm pretty tired to be honest and we have to go to the liv event tonight from to and then i'm pretty sure me and mama are going to go back to the room and just hang out go to bed,0
dustin johnson,1,2024-02,2024,67,0,1,1,you've had about minutes to reflect but sum up liv golf las vegas what's the first thing that comes to your mind about the three days,it was a great week great turnout today with the fans there was a ton of fans out there i felt like the energy was high it was a lot of fun obviously it was a little chilly and really breezy but the weather was really nice i think it was a great turnout and a great support you could feel the energy out there for sure,0
dustin johnson,1,2024-02,2024,56,0,1,1,it seems like liv continues to gain momentum what's the first thing that comes to your mind about liv golf at the moment,if it you haven't been to an event then i would invite you to come out and watch because you're going to like it i think it's just something that the fans really all the ones that come they all seem to like it they all seem to have a good time the more the merrier,0
dustin johnson,1,2024-02,2024,49,0,1,1,obviously you and bryson will be in the final group rahm could be the third is that what liv is kind of about is having those big names on the final day in the final group,yeah i think any golf tournament it doesn't matter but liv obviously there's a lot of really good players that are a part of liv i think each week you see the best players are always in the last groups teeing off on sunday or saturday i guess tomorrow,0
dustin johnson,1,2024-02,2024,18,0,1,1,pat we are in las vegas which i know you spend a lot of time here how excited are you to be having a tournament in vegas with liv and do you have any experience with this golf course,obviously there's a lot of good teams if we want to win we've got to play really well,0
dustin johnson,1,2024-02,2024,132,1,1,1,how shocked were you about the team result last week or did you feel like,i mean it's professional golf that's some of the best players in the world i think it's a little bit different than obviously the pga tour we have teams but i think the fan experience here is a lot more fun i think the player experience is more fun it's just a little bit we've got the music out on the range some music out on the course it's kind of just trending to where golf is going right now i think when you're at home playing with your buddies and you've got your music on you're having a good time i think that's what liv is all about but yes we are out here competing and at a very high level but you can still enjoy yourself while you're doing that,0
dustin johnson,1,2024-02,2024,38,0,1,1,would you agree with me that most of the people that knock the liv tour are conventional golfers old school holes music shorts that type of thing because they didn't grow up playing golf that way would you agree with me that that group has the biggest amount of criticism of the liv tour,i will be going to the game who do i have i'm not sure yet i'm still working on it i've got to wait until it gets a little closer to game time it's way too far away,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-10,2023,166,0,1,1,MODERATOR,i mean the aces are the strongest team on liv they won it last year they've led throughout the year this year but i'm really proud of my team for today and the effort that our guys made down the stretch to win and to finish the matches off i've got a little work to do a lot of work to do on my game overnight but i've got a team that has really made this fun and special and came through today i'm so proud of steeley and camo and riot and these guys that really played some great golf today we're looking forward to playing the best team in the league well consistently the best team in the league and we're looking forward to the opportunity we know it'll be a challenge but we had a lot of fun today we got a lot out of it we're going to try to recover recuperate build on it and put up a good fight tomorrow,0
dustin johnson,1,2023-10,2023,8,0,1,1,you mentioned that you had a different role with liv last year but now a year in the captaincy role how have you seen the league change over the year and what would you like to see evolve for the next year and going forward,i'm pretty old i know myself pretty well,0
dustin johnson,1,2023-10,2023,37,0,1,1,i just wanted to follow up on the world ranking thing you and talor are the guys that this impacts the most not having won majors and being young up and coming players how much did you consider that when you made the decision to come to liv did you think that your ranking wouldn't drop as fast as it has did you weigh all those issues,i really wasn't involved in it so i don't know to answer your question no i love my team and happy with it i mean even though they got a ringer they still struggled to keep up,0
dustin johnson,1,2023-10,2023,1,0,1,1,so we're two seasons in and i'm curious from a leadership perspective what do you think are the one or two things that you guys have learned about yourselves as leaders of liv leaders of your teams what have you learned about yourself the last couple years,no,0
dustin johnson,1,2023-08,2023,68,1,1,1,it was quite a scene for the first three holes with the former president following your group i know he has a relationship with dechambeau do you have any sort of relationship with him that sort of led to him following you guys like that,to me there's not any distractions the only thing that can distract me is myself whether i'm playing liv a major pga tour event whatever it is i feel the same on the first tee always just because i want to play well nerves but it's like good nerves just because i want to do well but yeah i feel the same every time on the first tee,0
dustin johnson,1,2023-08,2023,6,0,1,1,just wanted to ask you about the difference when you step up to the first tee at a liv event with the president here and the music i want to know your mindset when you're ready to hit do you block everything out can you explain when you're ready to hit with all those distractions going on,i would have to say doral,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-06,2023,147,1,0,1,MODERATOR,i played here a long time ago but i have really fond memories here with seve i had a really special relationship with seve i looked up to him as a kid and i had a chance to play a pga tour event with him in san diego and he was so kind so me and i really appreciated the time i spent with him and there were a lot of great memories from his captaincy in ' even though we lost by a point made a good sunday rally the memories i had were of seve leading his team and driving around the course and getting involved in what his players should do and try this shot and how creative he was i had a lot of great memories but a lot of them are from valderrama and i can't come here without thinking about him,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-06,2023,80,0,1,1,MODERATOR,it's aspirational it's not for everybody but it's a cool thing about her team and it's the creativity of my wife amy and what she brings we envision a lot of little kids running around the golf course in capes and that's kind of what we're hoping for and have them dreaming about being a hyflyer one day i know we're only one year into liv but where it's going to be in years it's going to be pretty exciting,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-06,2023,150,1,0,1,MODERATOR,yeah it pretty much jump started my career when i was over here on the challenge tour my first win was at the end of in spain and i think that kind of propelled me the next six months on the challenge tour which got me european tour and then was able to make the leap over to the pga tour it basically jump started my entire career you always look back at your first professional win and to me that meant a lot i think it definitely plays a role in everything i've done and like i've said it a million times it was the most fun i've ever had playing golf was traveling the world those early years and learning a lot learning about myself learning different countries learning different things it was so much fun i think it played a huge part in who i am today,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-06,2023,205,0,1,1,MODERATOR,it's been a pretty full schedule to me relative to what i was expecting it to be at playing events this year with the four majors and the liv events and playing in saudi arabia earlier this year so it's been a lot of golf but it's been fun because there's been enough breaks in between to where i get excited to get back out here we were talking with our teammates about how much we were looking forward to getting out here and playing and playing practice rounds together and competing again so there's enough of a time off in between where we get excited to get out here this is really a fun month for us to be over here in europe we've got two incredible liv events here this week at valderrama and next week in london before a little break to prepare for the british open i'm expecting a lot of players that aren't in the british to qualify and then there's a lot of players here that will be competing this will be an exciting month for the liv players as we really make a push to the second half of our season and it's been a lot of fun,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-06,2023,75,1,1,1,brooks you're currently in third place on the individual standings but it's really anybody's game it's a really tight race right now given your career accomplishments where would a season individual trophy kind of rank amongst all of your career accomplishments,i agree with both of them i think it's been fantastic i think you can see the way the schedule has played out how everyone has played in majors phil second i got second at the masters good showing by a bunch of liv guys at the pga and then the u s open as well i think the schedule has been fantastic it's definitely helped us in the preparation for the majors as well,0
dustin johnson,1,2023-06,2023,53,0,1,1,brooks you won twice in spain in your early years what do you remember of those years and how important were they for your wins recently,same for me all the guys i talk to that have played here said nothing but great things so i was excited to get here and once i saw the golf course it lived up to everything that people said about it yeah it's a fantastic golf course really excited for the week,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-06,2023,161,0,1,1,we've got this week and next before the next major i was curious how you've enjoyed balancing the liv schedule with the major schedule especially with the few countries we've played in,i think it's really a credit to robert trent jones sr who designed it and the way he made precision be such an important part of the test of golf rather than the ability to just overpower it so this is a great example when we talk about the golf ball going too far and so forth of how to create precision and ball striking and course management as the challenge rather than just brute strength the simplicity of the golf course the greens they're not over contoured they have just the right amount of movement they're small they're difficult the way each holes are shaped with the trees and the fairways moving you really have to be creative on club selection as well as shot making it's just a great overall test and it's not just about who hits the ball the longest it's about who can have the most complete golf game and it's really a great golf course,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-06,2023,80,0,1,1,brooks dj has there been much of a difference than previous years from a scheduling standpoint,i've been pretty happy with my decision to be here at liv i've enjoyed it i'm not going to speak for everybody else but i would say everybody is pretty excited and everybody is pretty happy with where they're at right now it's tough to look into the future and say i don't have any control over what other guys do but i know i'm happy where i'm at right now and just take it one day at a time,0
dustin johnson,1,2023-06,2023,57,0,1,1,dj did you as captain order the code red on pat perez's hair,yeah i'm excited for the future i think with this agreement the only thing that's going to happen is liv is going to get even better than what it is now which it's already great i'm happy exactly where i am and i'm definitely not looking to play more golf than i'm playing now that's for sure,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-06,2023,89,0,1,1,how excited have you been that you are playing here in spain at valderrama,somewhat i think that right now we have basically an agreement to have an agreement so there's really and everything over the last couple of years that we've been told by greg and everybody on liv has come to fruition so we have a lot of confidence in what they have been saying to us because everything has been happening we don't really feel the need to publicly posture our position there's really no need for us to talk about things publicly but to just let it play out,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-06,2023,33,1,1,1,with the framework agreement that was announced at the beginning of the month it seems like most people presume that you guys want to return to the pga tour yet just hearing you talk about how you prepared for the majors and the way the season flows it's actually a much better way for you guys just actually wondering if you do want to return to the pga tour in some form of fashion,i think actions are a little bit stronger than words i think if you just look at what liv is doing and what we're doing i think that is more of a statement,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-06,2023,63,0,1,1,oddly most people think that liv is going to go away they thought this agreement basically said that but you're talking about capes you're talking about the future it seems like all of you believe that this is going to be around for a while,rather than saying yes or no i know that from a player experience all of the difficulties and challenges and things that take a lot of excessive energy and output throughout the week have been fixed at liv so the player experience here is incredible i just can't envision a better scenario for me as a player than playing out here on liv,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-06,2023,129,1,1,1,phil about your links to spain you've been a long time without coming here but you have a good relationship with seve sergio and jon have you ever talked to them about the miracle of spanish golf very little players having major winners have you talked to them about that,i would say i felt appreciation that we got to this point where we're working together because it makes me confident with where the game of golf is headed in the future we felt like it was going to be about two years roughly before we got to that point it took a year and a half or six months quicker than i thought it would be going forward we're all very optimistic about where the game of golf professional golf specifically is headed also a lot of the changes that have been made because of liv were all very appreciative both on the liv tour as well as the pga tour and we're happy for the guys out there that they're having some positive changes there as well,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-06,2023,69,1,1,1,phil specifically do you have any interest in playing on the pga tour in the future,it's tough to speak for the european side i think that's we don't really have any involvement in that considering that we're all from the united states so it's very tough i think to be honest with you it's kind of unfortunate what happened i don't know we'll see hopefully there's a couple guys from liv that are playing the ryder cup here in three months so we'll see,0
dustin johnson,1,2023-05,2023,78,0,1,1,we had zach in here right before you and talking about obviously the liv guys and their potential for being on the ryder cup team first question is do you have an interest in being on the ryder cup team the second question is what do you think the likelihood is that you'll get picked,i mean i have no idea if i'd get picked obviously if i continue to play really well for the rest of the year then obviously there's a chance yes i would definitely like to play in the ryder cup it's one of my favorite events to play in especially after the last ryder cup obviously had a pretty good week and yeah it's just an awesome event and yeah i'd love to be a part of it,0
dustin johnson,1,2023-05,2023,58,0,1,1,going into augusta there was a lot of talk and brooks especially vocal about showing everybody that you guys are still the amazing golfers you are and continue to be with the performance of the liv league group at augusta has that burden kind of been shelved or do you still feel additional pressure to represent,i mean i think i've proven myself out here for a long enough time where i don't to me there is no to me i don't need to keep proving myself i already have for many years same with all the other guys it's just where we play at it doesn't change the style of golfer we are,0
dustin johnson,1,2023-05,2023,12,0,1,1,we're one year into the liv era what do you think the professional game is going to look like a few years from now,i don't know i can't predict the future i'm not real sure,0
dustin johnson,1,2023-05,2023,44,0,1,1,i'm just curious how has the travel and the difference in time zones affected you in terms of playing on liv,i mean to be honest with you it really hasn't a little more travel but i've played kind of all over the world my whole career i'm used to traveling whether a flight is five hours or eight hours doesn't really make a difference,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-04,2023,61,0,1,1,MODERATOR,but would love to do that we went to one of the afl games on sunday night i know me and dustin did so that was quite fun just getting to see it live anytime you watch guys do what they're amazing at and it's a cool sport it's fun it's a real sport those guys beat each other like crazy,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-04,2023,98,1,0,1,MODERATOR,i don't know if there's any other i don't know i haven't spoken to anybody that's on that level to be like hey are you coming over to play it's not my style it's not usually how i approach anybody look i'm sure there's a bunch of guys who are still looking to come over whether that be college players younger players to guys that play on the pga tour or dp tour i'm sure there are people looking to join but yeah you can always add depth to anything the stronger we get the better we are,0
dustin johnson,1,2023-04,2023,54,0,1,1,MODERATOR,yeah i think same obviously the better players we have playing obviously the stronger liv gets and it's better for the game as far as i haven't talked to greg this week so i don't know i can't really comment too much on what he was saying i didn't see what he said either,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-04,2023,83,0,1,1,MODERATOR,keegan matt fitzpatrick patrick cantlay lives on the same street fowler does as well i could run into tour guys if i wanted to in a day and nobody has really had any negative feedback any negative thing to say and that would be the time to say it but i think it was good just for the fans to see that we still communicate we still play together we still practice together do everything the exact same we're still the same people,0
dustin johnson,1,2023-04,2023,137,0,1,1,MODERATOR,yeah i'm the same obviously where we live i think half the golf world lives in south florida i see all the guys all the time it was nice to see at augusta see a few of the guys that you don't see in jupiter or out here on liv a couple buddies i got to see and hang out with but yeah the fans were great heard a lot of go aces and i think they were really good at augusta obviously that is one place where fans are always very respectful they don't really have a choice either but yeah it is the masters and i think everyone just respects augusta and the masters it's more about the golf than what tour you play on i think that's how it should be all the time,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-04,2023,127,0,1,1,MODERATOR,yeah i definitely have just from being at the game on sunday night to just being around for the last two days you see a lot of people just passing by you either in the hotel or things like that and at the game i think it's fantastic i think everyone is just super appreciative that we made the trip down here and we're playing because like you said it's been a long time since anybody has really been able to see the quality of field that i think we're bringing this week it's exciting it's going to be a big thing for cam's team the rippers it's going to be a big thing for liv and a big thing for australia and i think that's amazing,0
dustin johnson,1,2023-04,2023,88,0,1,1,greg earlier this week suggested that there's a long list of players queueing up to join the tour i just wondered if you guys had got any feedback about player feeling at the masters and as greg suggested do you concede that this tour still needs further depth to make it more viable,extracurricular it's a clothing company they're making all the clothes for the aces i think they also do all the merchandise for liv but it's just a new company and yeah we partnered with them and yeah they make great stuff i'm excited we just got a new shipment of shirts for this week but it's kind of just getting started so it's all kind of new it's going to continue to get better the stuff we're making right now is great and i really like wearing it,0
dustin johnson,1,2023-04,2023,1,1,1,1,just a question to all of you from the masters experience it seems that you guys were generally welcomed there within the cohort and also the fans do you all sense i guess a bit of a thawing not so much between the pga and liv but from a fans' perspective and your cohorts do you think the relationships are thawing now particularly sold out crowds here aussies are a pretty pragmatic bunch your thoughts on that,yeah,0
dustin johnson,1,2023-04,2023,171,0,1,1,following on from that a little bit you guys are now in the second season you've got a feel for liv how it's been received how big do you think this tour can get what would be your optimum number of players how many tournaments each year would you like to see where can it go,yeah i mean like i was saying earlier definitely driving because you've got to be able to you've got to hit it out of the fairway here because you've got to control the golf ball coming into the greens because they are fast they are undulated i think if you obviously got a bunch of rain on saturday but the fairways are still firm and fast greens are they're a little soft i think but they're fast if they can get those a little bit firmer i think that's the defense of the course with all the run offs around the greens like i said if you're coming from the fairway obviously you can control the ball a lot better i think that's kind of the defense is the narrow fairways the rough and obviously having firm fast undulating greens is going to that's where it but if you're driving it well the course plays pretty short you can definitely shoot some good scores but if not you're going to struggle,0
dustin johnson,1,2023-04,2023,98,0,1,1,i was just wondering i heard phil talk yesterday about the greens he said it reminded him of augusta in terms of the speed and the undulation mainly for dj and bryson because you played the course we touched on the length but where do you see the difficulties out there tomorrow and for the weekend,yeah i enjoy the game i've seen it a couple times on tv but watching it on tv especially when you don't know a sport or don't know a whole lot about it seeing it live was a lot better just to see what's all going on and understanding the game a little bit more i sat down with the premier for a few minutes and he explained to me kind of the game and so i understand it a lot better yeah it was fun and like he said it is a man's sport i'd like to,0
dustin johnson,1,2023-04,2023,27,1,1,1,what's the dynamic that i think a lot of golf fans standing around watching are wondering about the dynamic of liv and pga what's that like for you right now,for me it's the same all my buddies are still my buddies and we play and it's still golf so it doesn't matter where you play at,0
dustin johnson,1,2023-04,2023,94,0,1,1,nothing different,no i still play golf for a living i'm here at the masters and enjoying this week this week's all about augusta it has nothing to do with where you play at but guys that are here they play all around the world not everybody just plays on one spot for me like i said all my buddies are still my buddies enjoy seeing them it's nice to see a lot of the guys because i haven't seen them all that much so it should be a great week and looking forward to it,0
dustin johnson,1,2023-04,2023,58,1,0,1,did it make you feel good to hear i don't know if you heard it but a lot of guys on pga tour were asked who they miss the most and you're pretty much the name that always comes up,yeah that's always nice like i said a lot of the guys i'm good friends with played a lot of golf with all of them and enjoy being around them it's nice this week to get to see them all and play a few practice rounds with some of my buddies yeah it will be a great week,0
dustin johnson,1,2023-04,2023,55,0,1,1,you mentioned these guys that you know so well that you're used to seeing every single week when you're able to reunite now is there any talk about that stuff are you ribbing each other just catching up,yeah it's nice to see them and hang out with them i hadn't seen them as much as i usually do most of the guys i get to see because they all i mean everybody lives in jupiter i see most of them a good bit so just the guys that don't live down there,0
dustin johnson,1,2023-02,2023,122,0,1,1,MODERATOR,yeah i mean well for me obviously i've been with adidas i was with them for years we had a great relationship it's still really good we mutually agreed on parting ways it just wasn't working how it was just with my new obviously playing for liv and the way things kind of go it was better for both of us to part ways for me being the captain of the team obviously being able to go out and find a clothing sponsor is more beneficial than waiting another year which we probably will have something hopefully my clothes get out of customs and i'll have some stuff to wear by this weekend but if not i'll be wearing some blank stuff,0
dustin johnson,1,2023-02,2023,43,0,1,1,i guess you're no longer with adidas does any of that open an opportunity for the whole franchise concept with liv because now there is space to sell for the team and possibly could you explain maybe how you envision that working throughout this year,yeah we all talked about it because obviously there was a few options and we felt like pete was the best option for our team so then we asked pete if he wanted to join and he said yeah it was really simple,0
dustin johnson,1,2023-02,2023,52,0,1,1,i talked to abe ancer and he told me that liv golf changed the chip of every one of you in the course do you consider this is true to change the chip the way you feel about golf and the way you feel in the course,i don't think so i think obviously last year we had a lot of success and i think this year is obviously trying to continue that and grow the teams and grow the following and fans i think we've gotten a lot of support so excited to see what the year brings,0
dustin johnson,1,2022-10,2022,82,0,1,1,pat before the season started you and i met and i interviewed you and you told me off mic a conversation you had with dj before you joined would you mind to disclose that now,just look at what happened today obviously yeah it was a team effort but coming down the th hole it ended up coming down to me and cam playing the th hole to see who wins the team championship you couldn't have drawn it up any better but i think that's what liv is look at all the fans look how much fun they have i think this season went incredible and i think next season is going to be even better,0
brooks koepka,1,2022-10,2022,4,0,1,1,for all four captains just going from two days of match play to now stroke play all four rounds count that's the first time that's happened in a liv round what's the mentality in making switch from match play to stroke play dj maybe start first,add a couple zeros,0
dustin johnson,1,2022-10,2022,77,0,1,1,brooks you guys are on a roll right now just the mentality of switching back to stroke play you have four strong guys playing well now,but yeah for us it's all about the competition we want to win the first championship of liv golf and yeah i mean it's all about tomorrow it's anybody's ballgame i don't think there's every team up here obviously is playing well there's no favorites in my eyes tomorrow you know it's what four guys can play the best on the teams obviously because all four scores count so everybody on your team has to play well,0
dustin johnson,1,2022-10,2022,54,0,1,1,not really sure who to send this question to but if any of you want to speak up go for it do any of you feel a sense of rivalry with any other team in this league or any other golfer in this league and if not how do you see rivalry being created manifesting in the league,it would be great obviously it's the first liv team championship it's kind of the first year of this and i think it's gone really well and it just kind of sets up for things to come yeah i think it would be amazing and it's something that we all really want to win,0
cameron smith,1,2022-10,2022,72,0,1,1,how much,it wouldn't really bother me to be honest i think like all other events i don't know if it's the same for these guys but i spend more time looking at the team leaderboard than i do the actual individual leaderboard so i don't know it's quite unique but that's what i love about liv golf it's just so different and you're worried about your mates sometimes more than you are yourself,0
brooks koepka,1,2022-10,2022,31,0,1,1,i was wondering if every team in the liv tour was to play in a beer pong tournament who would win,yeah i mean i think we've all played so much golf together it doesn't really matter all three of them are pretty damn good players i'll take any one of them,0
dustin johnson,1,2022-10,2022,6,0,1,1,it was a little lively,yeah that's fine it should be,0
dustin johnson,1,2022-10,2022,60,0,1,1,obviously on sunday provided you make it that far all four rounds count first time this has happened at liv what do you think of that,i think it's great the four teams that make it to sunday any four of them can win it doesn't matter what team it is they've all got just as good a chance as you do i think it's definitely going to make for interesting tv just because all four guys got to play well if you want to win,0
dustin johnson,1,2022-10,2022,32,0,1,1,did you think in june of ' when you made the decision to come to liv did you think that you would be where you are right now with million worth of winnings and all the positivity that liv has created,yeah i'm actually a little under where i thought i would be but you know i've done okay i didn't quite reach my goal but yeah i'm happy with it so far,0
dustin johnson,1,2022-10,2022,90,0,1,1,so you're million richer how would you describe this four and a half month journey you've had with liv has it met your expectations exceeded it,you know for me it's no different than the saudi invitational inaudible we might have got the no seed i just want to beat yeah the golf tournament the course is different right now it's softer that's about the only thing it's in pretty good shape but soft which is kind of weird playing usually the ball is running and the fairways are firm other than that we'll prepare like we do every week and if you want to win you're going to have to really golf your ball well,0
dustin johnson,1,2022-10,2022,36,0,1,1,and the conditions and the weather i suppose would that be a little bit of concern about the stamina for the players and the hydration this week it's pretty steamy out there,yeah it is warm i live in south florida so i'm kind of used to it it's not quite this humid there but i don't mind the heat and the ball goes further so it's nice,0
dustin johnson,1,2022-10,2022,229,0,1,1,you're one of the early players who joined liv golf since the very beginning in london your own impression of how it's progressed and is there anything you would like to see improve or perhaps expand upon as the years go by,i mean i think you could ask anybody i think for me it's gone really well it's gone better than even i expected it to i think it's just going to keep getting better and keep getting more recognition around the world i think we're already starting to a lot i think the media and everybody is starting to finally catch on that this is not a joke it's real golf and we've got some of the best players in the world obviously we don't have all of them but we've got enough of them i think it's gone great i really enjoy it i love being out here i love playing i love being a part of it and starting something new i think the team aspect brings a whole different kind of flavor to golf and it's something that people and fans can get behind and obviously we're going to play in all different parts of the world i've never played golf in thailand i've never played a tournament here so it's a new place some people have seen us on tv but they've never seen us play in person going to different places and all that which we'll have the opportunity to do on the liv tour is going to help grow the game and i think they're doing a good job with that so far,0
dustin johnson,1,2022-10,2022,66,0,1,1,this is a question about world ranking points even with the players being able to earn points on different tours are you still hopeful that liv will be able to earn world ranking points eventually,yeah i think so i don't see how they don't award us points like i said i think it's supposed to be a non biased organization so we are playing golf competing with some of the best golfers in the world so yes we should be awarded points will they do that hopefully like i said i think we deserve them and hopefully we'll get them,0
dustin johnson,1,2022-09,2022,19,0,1,1,for all of you just your thoughts on the week this venue the gallery response from people here in chicago and would you all like to hopefully come back with liv golf here next year,that would have been fine too we wanted to win but a tie would have been kind of fun,0
dustin johnson,1,2022-09,2022,40,1,0,1,talk about the golf course in comparison to over courses on the pga tour,yeah the course is great obviously it's in perfect condition i played really nicely hit the ball really well hit it close to the hole a lot of times all day long so obviously put together a really nice score,0
dustin johnson,1,2022-09,2022,39,1,0,1,are you surprised that chicago hasn't been able to hold down a pga tour event year after year,i mean there's tons of good courses in this area i've played quite a few of them around here and there's a lot of good ones this is one of them too like i said it's in perfect condition,0
dustin johnson,1,2022-09,2022,39,0,1,1,a lot of chatter last week from other players at the bmw championship about liv guys not deserving to be in certain events what's the thought or maybe feeling when those boys are out there being nasty like that,yeah i'm not real sure i don't understand it but the guys that were there they were qualified for the event so why they have an issue with that i'm not real sure again you'd have to ask them,0
dustin johnson,1,2022-09,2022,43,0,1,1,how do you mentally prep after a day like this to kind of duplicate it tomorrow or on sunday and what are you doing from a healthcare perspective for longevity i know the schedule is good with liv golf but what are you doing personally to benefit your own health and well being,i mean i've got a trainer and got a pt guy too so i try to train as much as i can just to stay healthy and stay as fit as i can just to be out here and compete with these guys,0
dustin johnson,1,2022-09,2022,119,0,1,1,MODERATOR,it means a lot obviously with the caliber of players that are playing especially now on liv we've got great fields every week we're going to continue to have great fields it's probably going to even get better starting next year but even right now our fields are unbelievable for me it's something new it's something exciting i'm really enjoying being out here and we're playing at great venues and they do a wonderful job putting on the tournaments i think you talk to any of the fans the players whoever staff they do a great job taking care of everyone and making it a great experience for everyone i'm just really happy to be a part of it,0
dustin johnson,1,2022-07,2022,95,1,0,1,dj how would this have held up at the pga championship it seems like there's probably some room to back it up and make it even harder it's not that easy now,yeah i mean this golf course it's hard game plan doesn't change just try to get it in the fairway and then if you can somehow get an uphill putt but it seems like i've been putting downhill all week even the uphill putts feel like they're downhill i don't know the greens are fast but yeah just try to first and foremost you've got to get it in the fairway just to be able to control the golf ball coming into these greens yeah i don't know i didn't see what he finished at,0
dustin johnson,1,2022-07,2022,1,0,1,1,carlos what would you say to mexican fans there's been a lot of skepticism around liv golf what would you tell them about the decision of playing here,close,0
dustin johnson,1,2022-07,2022,81,0,1,1,d j you're up there gooch is up there sergio is under poulter and westwood are playing well have the liv guys been galvanised at all by everything that's been said the last few weeks,i don't i mean i don't really know what you're talking about for me obviously they're all good players and playing well this week for me coming in here obviously it's a major i want to come in here and play well and compete i feel like i put myself in a good position going into the weekend probably be a few back by the end of the day i would imagine still in a good spot going into the weekend,0
dustin johnson,1,2022-07,2022,30,0,1,1,talor gooch said that liv golf has banded together this week considering all the negativity surrounding you is that the case how does that make you feel is it motivating you in any way,not me because honestly i don't read anything so i wouldn't know what you were saying or if there was anything negative being said i don't pay attention to it,0
dustin johnson,1,2022-07,2022,34,0,1,1,with the controversy surrounding the liv golfers particularly this week has it felt a different experience this open or do you feel when you're out on the course the crowds just want to see good golf,yeah the crowds have been fantastic i've always had a lot of support over here yeah it's been that way this week a lot of support out there and the fans have been great,0
dustin johnson,1,2022-07,2022,96,0,1,1,branden fairly familiar place that you're in especially compared to the last time in london how do you feel going into tomorrow,no obviously i've never played out here especially as a pro i've played down in bend in college a couple times so a lot of these fans they haven't seen any of the pros really play especially not in their area obviously they're excited to be out here obviously it's a great event i think liv has done a great job putting on the event the fan experience i think is unbelievable obviously you can tell with the fans out there they're excited they've got a lot of energy and i think they're really enjoying it,0
dustin johnson,1,2022-06,2022,51,0,1,1,this is the first time we've seen you since you played in the first liv event how does it feel coming back and seeing all the other golfers not just the fans is there any difference there's obviously a lot of buzz around who's going and who's not et cetera,no i mean i haven't really noticed any difference obviously anytime coming to a u s open it's a great event you know it's going to be a good one just obviously felt like i'm playing pretty well just need to tighten it up just a little bit come the weekend,1
dustin johnson,1,2022-06,2022,8,0,1,1,you obviously want to be competing and contending in majors how sharp do you think you'll be able to remain as a golfer playing on the liv tour,just as sharp as i would playing anywhere,1
dustin johnson,1,2022-06,2022,20,0,1,1,did you feel any kind of apprehension or tension coming in here coming from liv golf tour,no not at all i was coming in here preparing getting ready to try and win a u s open,1
dustin johnson,1,2022-06,2022,46,0,1,1,did you use your own attorney to negotiate your deal with liv,yeah david and then well they're both named david laughter yeah they kind of worked together but obviously i will always have my attorney even when david does a contract i always have him look through it to make sure everything is how we want it,1
dustin johnson,1,2022-06,2022,170,1,1,1,do you feel like you were able to settle into just playing golf everything that's gone on all the noise outside to be able to just play golf,yeah you know i feel like this week obviously once i decided to come to play here i felt like especially over the last months or so deciding to kind of trying to figure out if i was going to stick to playing on the pga tour if i was going to join liv so it was always kind of in my mind and then obviously once i decided to do this yeah it kind of obviously now my focus is just on golf and playing as good as i can and so yeah this week has been great i felt like the game is there i made just made too many mistakes the last two days and it cost me quite a few shots or i'd be up there right around the lead but obviously if the conditions stay the same i feel like i'm playing well enough where i can go out and shoot a really good score and maybe i'll try to challenge charl a little bit,1
dustin johnson,1,2022-06,2022,21,0,1,1,it's been hours since jay monahan's memo have you spoken to anyone if there is any legal recourse,i have not at this point my plan is to play the liv events and a few majors and that's it,1
dustin johnson,1,2022-06,2022,23,0,1,1,that's it,well that was the whole reason that was the whole reason i started playing on liv is to play less golf not more,1
dustin johnson,1,2022-05,2022,7,1,0,1,would you say driving the ball well is a big factor in pga championships like a common denominator,it's a big factor in any championship,0
dustin johnson,1,2022-05,2022,111,1,0,1,but for the pga is there a denominator like longer,yeah to win a major especially a pga championship everything in your game has to be working well you can't just drive it well especially a golf course like this you've got a lot of mid to long irons you get a few wedges and there's some short holes where you can make some birdies but you still have to be firing on all cylinders especially with these greens there's a lot of they're small but they're undulated you're going to have a lot of pins on top of slopes so you've got to be coming out of the fairway so you can control the spin and control the golf ball,0
dustin johnson,1,2022-04,2022,49,1,0,1,of course when you won here in it was a record setting performance that november masters but that's your last official win on the pga tour but you had a really solid showing there at the match play finishing fourth i wonder from a mindset standpoint how confident were you with your game coming to augusta this week,the game is starting to feel a lot better getting more and more comfortable over the golf ball and getting more comfortable hitting golf shots it's starting to around and obviously it's trending in the right direction especially coming into this week and obviously off to a solid start,0
dustin johnson,1,2022-03,2022,99,1,0,1,i don't think we've had an opportunity to talk to you since your statement came out sunday of riv week i'm curious in hindsight how much was all that circling a distraction to you,well a little bit to do with what he was saying is i haven't been playing that well don't know if it was if it had anything to do with that but just wanted to have my complete focus on golf and playing on the pga tour that was the main reason for the statement yeah i mean obviously it was something that you had to have a little bit of interest in in my position but like i said talking with my family and my friends and my team i think we made the best decision for me,0
dustin johnson,1,2021-08,2021,88,1,0,1,and i know you haven't had a good answer to this before and i'm actually not expecting one now but last year when you had the double rounds of s and another one in minnesota and you withdraw and then all of a sudden you come back and it's like you're a brand new person from the pga and onward is it that easy for you to just flip the switch,yes it is as far as why i can't tell you why for me obviously i know i'm a good player i've been a really good player for a long time so playing a few bad rounds doesn't really bother me too much obviously i know i need to go work on some things which is what i did any time no matter how bad i'm playing it only takes one shot here or one shot there where i get a nice feel and it turns everything around,0
dustin johnson,1,2021-08,2021,9,1,0,1,if you'd have been told in january that we're in august you and still haven't won on the pga tour what would have been your reaction to that,i would have said i was probably struggling laughter,0
dustin johnson,1,2021-06,2021,41,1,0,1,what would it mean to you to win in south carolina pga i know you've won in south carolina but a pga tour event in south carolina,it would be great obviously it's my home state it's where i grew up it's kind of where i honed my skills throughout my especially early days all through college yeah it would mean a lot to win in south carolina,0
dustin johnson,1,2021-05,2021,68,1,0,1,you played with shane lowry on monday and i see you're grouped with shane for the first two rounds here at kiawah island just wonder did shane take your money or did you take his money,i put it in at the pga last year at harding park i've always been kind of looking for a wood hybrid or something i can get up in the air and land soft keith made me a wood at harding park and i hit it a few times really liked it and it's been in the bag ever since hit a lot of different shots with it,0
dustin johnson,1,2021-05,2021,47,0,1,1,what do you enjoy about playing with shane's company and what do you like about him as a golfer having won the open and also as an individual,yeah i watched quite a few games i was living in myrtle beach so i would drive down for the weekend or for a game or something it's only an hour and minutes it was great it was always fun coming down and watching my brother play,0
dustin johnson,1,2021-05,2021,2,1,0,1,where does the pga rank on your list of accomplishments that you haven't reached yet and would it be extra special to win here at the ocean course,a taylormade,0
dustin johnson,1,2021-05,2021,4,1,0,1,if you can think back what would be and we'll see how this week plays out going into it but the toughest pga since when when is the last one that got your attention in this way the pga,whistling straits is tough,0
dustin johnson,1,2021-04,2021,12,0,1,1,brooks said no matter whether tiger plays or not he should be no because he's the guy that kind of what he said is you guys are making all this money because of tiger do you agree that even if he doesn't swing a club this calendar year that he'll probably still be no,i'm going to live in that area yes sir i'm not moving,0
dustin johnson,1,2021-04,2021,60,0,1,1,you said you're in between are you still living are you going to be living in north palm beach,i mean yes and no i mean augusta is closer to where i live than kiawah but yeah i mean it obviously is great to play a major in my home state and depending on how many fans are there i'll have a lot of support definitely looking forward to it obviously i played there when was it there last,0
dustin johnson,1,2021-04,2021,11,1,0,1,what are your plans for the next few weeks,i'm playing tampa tampa and then probably the nelson and pga,0
dustin johnson,1,2021-04,2021,9,1,0,1,kind of a random question here going back to the pga championship from last summer at tpc harding park the th hole was a drivable par but for an extremely long player it might have put you in a little bit of an awkward position where were you in terms of club selection could you hit driver or would it have gone sailing way over the green,a little cut yeah just a little chippy cut,0
dustin johnson,1,2021-04,2021,107,0,1,1,your grandfather art what a great guy and condolences do you have a story or thoughts on how he shaped you and austin when you guys were growing up,yeah i mean he was always a big part of both of our lives just with sports he was a huge sports fan didn't matter what sport it was he thought he knew how to play it and he was good at it that's for sure even with golf even though i don't think he ever even hit a golf ball he would still try to tell me how to play that's just how he was as a kid and playing all the different sports he was always there and always real supportive so obviously definitely going to miss him but yeah he's in a good place,0
dustin johnson,1,2021-03,2021,105,1,0,1,they said on the broadcast that you withdrew yourself from consideration for the olympics what went into that decision,i don't know i really didn't think much about it i actually didn't really ever decide whether i was going to play or not i just didn't sign up but it's right in the middle of a big stretch of golf for me so that was the reason i was kind of waffling on it a little bit it's a long way to travel and i think wgc is the week right after it the british is a couple weeks before it it's a lot of traveling at a time where it's important for me to feel like i'm focused playing on the pga tour,0
dustin johnson,1,2021-02,2021,76,1,0,1,you won the masters as world no and another victory as world no how much satisfaction does that give to you win as the world's no golfer,yeah it's tough to win on the european tour pga tour no matter what ranking you are but yeah obviously winning as no is definitely good and obviously it gives me a little bit more of a lead it gives me a lot of confidence going in for the rest of the year obviously we're at the beginning of the year so pleased with how i'm playing and looking forward to the rest of the year,0
dustin johnson,1,2021-02,2021,55,1,0,1,major championship pga tour victory what does a stand alone european tour victory mean to you it's different isn't it,well i've won here a couple years ago finished second last year i like this golf course i like the tournament i think the saudi golf they do a great job hosting us and put on a great event so obviously the field they have this year was really good so it's a big win,0
dustin johnson,1,2020-11,2020,46,1,0,1,MODERATOR,well i think the pga tour has done a great job with the plan they have implemented and the guysâ€‘â€‘ i mean all the guys out here take it seriously i think they do a really good job and that's why we haven't had a problem,0
phil mickelson,1,2024-03,2024,260,0,1,1,andy you've honed your career playing on the asian tour success in the international series and earned your place on liv golf through the asian tour order of merit last year how does it feel being back this week in asia competing in liv golf hong kong,i think what we all love about this golf course is you talk about strategic and strategy and how to play certain holes there's a lot of ways to play the holes i love the par s i think they're some of the best par s we've seen and they challenge you and push you with precision rather than distance you've got to hit very precise shots the greens are small and they're just very cool fun challenges there are a lot of ways to play some of these holes out here and i try to have one two or three options based on how i feel or how i'm playing or how the round is going or how i'm hitting it that particular day case in point would be the th hole that's a very interesting short par where you could have a iron and a pitching wedge or you could try to hit a wood or driver over the trees and get on the green or you could try to hit a or iron a little further up there about yards it'll kind of depend how i'm feeling how the round is going it's early in the round how did the first few holes go do i need to kind of push something or not i think that makes for a very interesting tournament because of the number of ways to play so many of these holes different clubs off the tee different shots into the green it's just a very fun strategic cool golf course to play,0
phil mickelson,1,2024-03,2024,83,1,1,1,obviously most of the story yesterday was around the points i asked jon rahm yesterday morning whether he thought it was maybe time for the players to force the issue not just on liv but on the pga because obviously xander and patrick and will and matt had some things to say from your point of view do you think the players could force the issue and do you think actually the time is probably gone to do so,so over the last maybe year or so i've kind of expressed my thoughts not thoughts but also shared what exactly is happening on some of the inner workings of that situation i don't really have more to add i've been pretty clear on what's going on and my thoughts via twitter which is much easier to get those thoughts out i don't really have any more to add but it is all starting to play out just like we thought it would,0
phil mickelson,1,2024-03,2024,110,0,1,1,your role seems like more than a captain in liv golf what do you think about your role in liv golf,well it's nice of you to say that i'm proud to be a part of liv golf and all the players on liv are proud to be out here and enjoying it i think for me at this particular moment for me to best help liv golf succeed and be successful the best way i can do that is to play well i'm really trying to get my game sharp i had a lot of progress last week i really want to come in this game and play well because i feel like if i play well i can help push and promote liv golf in the best possible way,0
phil mickelson,1,2024-03,2024,148,0,1,1,what part of liv golf should improve from your point of view,i don't know specifically what we could really do to improve we're a startup there's a lot of things we can adjust to make it better and we continue to do so weekly and make subtle changes but our product is extremely strong we have so many of the best players in the world and the ability to move the best players around the world to showcase golf at the highest level into parts of the world that have never been exposed to it has really helped pushing the game i'm very proud about the partnership of what liv is doing i probably shouldn't say about i don't know if it's public knowledge so i'll hold back but on bringing the game of golf to people in parts of the world that wouldn't be exposed to it i'm very proud to be a part of that as well,0
phil mickelson,1,2024-03,2024,243,0,1,1,amongst the many things that liv golf has really done well is the pro am format the amateurs are so happy to play with two professionals the professionals are happy to just play nine holes can you talk about that part of it and how interesting has that been,so i think it's a very big thing an important part of the overall experience meaning the interaction on pro am day between the players and the amateurs is important because many of those players are people that are making decisions to support the game of golf to sponsor the game of golf to support other pros or just bring notoriety to the game we rely on having the best players play in those pro ams to make it the best experience and i think that week in and week out to have it be nine holes it helps the pros be ready for the tournament and not make them over tired and over worn out the day before the event and as an amateur you're experiencing two pros and have a two pro experience and get to know two guys intimately in a way that you wouldn't otherwise be able to it's a positive for both sides when that was discussed with liv it made sense and we did it conversely i tried for years to make that happen on the tour and then we got two events to do it and then we got four events to do it and it took years to get something like that done i think that shows how fluid liv golf is and the ability to do whatever we can to make it a better experience and make decisions quickly and move swiftly to improve,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-10,2023,166,0,1,1,MODERATOR,i mean the aces are the strongest team on liv they won it last year they've led throughout the year this year but i'm really proud of my team for today and the effort that our guys made down the stretch to win and to finish the matches off i've got a little work to do a lot of work to do on my game overnight but i've got a team that has really made this fun and special and came through today i'm so proud of steeley and camo and riot and these guys that really played some great golf today we're looking forward to playing the best team in the league well consistently the best team in the league and we're looking forward to the opportunity we know it'll be a challenge but we had a lot of fun today we got a lot out of it we're going to try to recover recuperate build on it and put up a good fight tomorrow,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-10,2023,314,1,0,1,MODERATOR,yeah i think that brooks has played some of the best golf of anybody in the world this year he won the pga he played phenomenal in the majors played phenomenal out here just won last week like it's not there's a lot of other guys i would rather be playing against so i've got my work cut out for me but i have the utmost respect for him and any time i have a chance to play with him or against him i enjoy it he is always professional to play with play against and i expect that we are going to have a fun match but there's also a mutual respect between us that i believe we share and i think it's going to be you know very professional and i'm hoping that i can play some of my best golf because i know i need to to just make it competitive now that we know the team matchups we need to reveal the players that will be competing against each other now this is the first time we are going to be hearing of all of this i don't know who is playing against who either captains don't even know who the other captains have selected to play individual matches or the foursomes so this is going to be fun lots of great storylines as a reminder the captains will play each other in the individual match play so it is now time to reveal the individual matches first up stinger versus iron heads obviously we have louis versus kevin the other singles match will be branden grace versus scott vincent and that leaves us for the foursome with deane burmester charl schwartzel sihwan kim and danny lee louis we'll start with you how do you feel about the matchups what was your decision to not put branden in the foursomes,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-10,2023,87,0,1,1,MODERATOR,yeah i mean i don't have anything to say but compliments about brooks and his play and what he's done this year and what he's done for his own game but also for liv golf i'm excited for the opportunity to play against him but like i said there's a lot of other guys i'd rather play against he just won last week and he's played some exceptional golf and i'm going to have to bring out some of my best golf just to make me competitive,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-10,2023,195,1,0,1,did you seriously not know you would win an extra million on sunday and have you got some crap or that since,i guess i don't i'm just bringing like facts to life as to like why that's happening but really we as a group as a league that's trying to grow the game and bring it globally and promote the game throughout the world as well as bring something different than the old stodgy format that we've had for decades we just need to focus on what we are doing and make our product as good as possible as interesting as possible we need to make tweaks into our program the owgr need to obviously make tweaks but we need to tweak our format to continue to evolve and be more interesting and easier to understand we have enough on our plate to make our product more and more exciting and appealing that we shouldn't worry ourselves with what they are doing but i do want to bring to light as to why exactly they are doing what they are doing it's not what they are putting out there on the front page there's a lot more going on behind the scenes as to the importance of us to the getting points to the pga tour,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-10,2023,74,1,1,1,what was your reaction when you found out,i think that the majors need to protect their product and there's probably other ways that they can do that by creating slots if they want to make sure they have the best fields in golf they could create vehicles for players on liv to play in majors where they don't have to use the owgr which would undermine the tv contract and revenue of the pga tour if they gave points to liv,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-10,2023,137,1,0,1,is that a shame as a captain don't you think you should,i wasn't intentionally playing slow i know that in the ' pga final round brooks felt the same way but really all i was trying to do was get a visualization of the shot and get in kind of like my own little bubble and world maybe i was playing slow maybe i wasn't it wasn't my intent my intent was to get into a calm state and have good visualization and play my best golf and unfortunately i lost on the last hole to cam but look i'm going to be trying to do the same thing tomorrow i'm not trying to play slow i'm always saying look go ahead go ahead and hit like i'm not trying to throw you out of your rhythm but i don't want to be taken out of mine either,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-10,2023,75,0,1,1,my question is for phil we saw your reaction last week to the owgr ruling and i just wanted to follow on that to you they did open the door or leave open the possibility that liv could resubmit its bid or its application how do you feel about that do you feel that liv should reapply do you think that they should make the changes that they are sort of hinting at to try to comply whenever that might be,no he's not seen me on a course yet yeah he'll be him and jena are going to come down later in the week i don't think he's going to come to the course but it would be nice to finally i guess get done playing or get done practicing whatever it might be and get to go home and go spend time with him new experience for me so i'm looking forward to it,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-10,2023,57,0,1,1,are following up on what you said earlier you said liv needs to continue to evolve how would you like to see liv evolve now that you've seen it for one full season now,yeah listen i watched chase work over the last year and a half spent more time around him it's been fun for me to see him evolve grow as a person grow as a man i'd take him back in a heartbeat you know he's just got to go out and do play good simple as that,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-10,2023,159,1,0,1,you got cam last year and brooks this year two of the best players out here not the easiest draws you've had for match play cam said last year you had a little gamesmanship in your match and said you designed of took forever out there are you planning on using that again this year against brooks to try and slow him about a little bit,i think he's an incredible talent our team is very invested in his success and we want him to succeed we've enjoyed our time together so he's a great addition to the team and we're going to miss him if he's not on the team because of the many intangibles he brings but the reality is i've been fielding calls as we all have from players that are free agents to pga tour players to dp world tour players that want to come over you know the spot's probably going to be filled by the time the qualifying tournament is here so if i'm just being truthful that's a very real possibility and even if it is filled there's always the possibility of a trade to get him back there's ways this could work out but i think there's a good chance based on the number of calls that we've had that the spot will be filled fairly soon,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-10,2023,104,0,1,1,similar to what phil answered what is your stance on the situation with the world golf ranking points and the future with liv in those points,do i think that no i know that's going to happen when players look at liv they are wanting to be a part of it everybody here is happy and enjoying what we are doing and enjoying the team aspect of it and enjoying each other and the camaraderie and enjoying playing golf globally and all the benefits that come with playing this tour so there's a lot of players that see that and want to be a part of it the question is you know how many spots are available there's a lot more players that want to come than there are spots,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-10,2023,34,0,1,1,my question is for cam brooks phil and kevin na all four of you have teammates that are in the relegation spot there's going to be a promotion event that happens in a few weeks where they have one last chance to get in the top three to earn their spot back to liv golf next year if one of your guys is in one of three spots are you taking them back on your team cam phil kevin and brooks what do you think,there's a lot of players that could be signed not even through the qualifying you know there's spots on teams that are open that players want to come over and be a part of,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-08,2023,86,1,0,1,six major championships pga tour wins will you still be nervous tomorrow,i'm sure i'm sure there's an element i haven't won since the pga in ' so it's been a couple years and i would love getting back into that feeling of having a chance to win and having each shot bring that pressure about sure i'll feel it that's why we still want to play or i still want to play because i love that challenge of trying to compete and trying to do that and i still get nervous every time i have a chance,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-08,2023,94,0,1,1,this is obviously the best position you've been in at a liv event what kind of thoughts or emotions are going through your mind right now,it's a lot of fun i've been working hard and i have not had results and i'm finally scoring a little bit better and it's fun to have a chance tomorrow it's fun for our team to have a chance i mean this is why i've been working hard is to try to get these opportunities to be in contention on sunday and try to close it out try to get our team up on the podium myself up on the podium it's really fun and exciting it's been a fun first couple days,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-08,2023,63,0,1,1,obviously you've been defying age for the last few years what would it mean to win a liv event at,yeah it would mean a lot to me to win one of these events i am really trying hard that's a strong goal of mine i'm working really hard to do it this is a great stepping stone for me to build on and to have that opportunity tomorrow and we'll see how it goes tomorrow this has been a lot of fun,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-08,2023,77,1,1,1,phil we spent a lot of time today talking about the kids and their superpowers can you tell us a little bit about that,yeah it was awesome for the tournament for him for liv for everyone involved because that's a tour caliber golf course and he shot a and a on that course is just incredible but to see him play well is also just great for the game of golf whether it's for liv pga tour seeing him be at his best he's an exciting charismatic figure in the game and having him play well is good for everyone,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-08,2023,166,0,1,1,phil want to get your quick thoughts on mr on bryson dechambeau and his incredible not only round but two rounds over the weekend and get your thoughts on it,he's our silent assassin he doesn't say much he just delivers he birdied the last three holes to put a nice exclamation point but we had a good time and i thought that was a really cool thing that we were able to do we wouldn't be able to do that outside of liv and to bring fans into a more personal experience of a practice round kind of gamesmanship a fun little match things like that i thought was really cool bryson is ahead of the game bryson is on top of that that was his team they put that thing together they shot the video they edited it and he has a great grasp of how to bring the game to a lot of people and bring parts of the game that aren't normally seen and i thought that was kind of like a behind the scenes match that isn't normally seen and i'm appreciative that we're able to do that here on liv,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-08,2023,185,1,1,1,phil you guys played the match on wednesday so you were basically the inspiration for,so it's one of my favorite things about playing professional golf and being in the position that we're in which is to have an impact or to provide a special moment for others like these young adaptive golfers just giving them some time and a moment that they might remember we're in a position to do that that not everybody is it's fun for us to do that it could be just little giving a golf ball to someone or it could be helping them through their game or being a good friend to them but david finn back in when i won baltusrol was out there and supportive and i could tell he was a huge golf fan we hit it off and became close and i had him on the green celebrating the victory with the trophy he is golf's biggest fan he knows more about the pros he has relationships with so many pga tour and liv tour pros that he's golf's biggest fan and he's so knowledgeable about everybody that he's become a very special part of the game of golf,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-08,2023,203,0,1,1,going back to bryson he's obviously played well not just this past week but he's been playing well in the majors when you look at the ryder cup coming up he's obviously not going to have a chance to be in that top i'm curious what your opinion is as somebody who's been such a huge part of the ryder cup obviously brooks is going to be there can you imagine the ryder cup without bryson the way he's playing right now,that's a tough question to answer because there's some players here on liv that have played some golf that i would argue is some of the best in the world bryson his last week is one of the best performances in the game i think talor gooch is one of the best performances of the year and brooks is one of the toughest competitors and then you always want to throw dj or patrick reed in there because of their consistency they've aces to a number of victories you've got four or five guys here that you can make an argument are some of the best american players for sure but you also have as we know a team dynamic is very important and as we've created a dynamic here of support where we're helping each other be our best you want to have that same dynamic for the ryder cup to bring out the best in each other it's also understandable if that's not the case if as a captain you decide to go with a team that brings about a certain chemistry but if you're looking just straight for the best players there's four or five guys here that warrant that,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-08,2023,64,0,1,1,do you have a level of curiosity and what is your level of curiosity to see how it is going to unfold and see how many liv guys zach does bring over if anybody beyond brooks,so i've kind of detached from that a little bit i've accepted the fact that i've had or years of great ryder cup experiences as a player one as a vice captain i've enjoyed my time but i've detached and kind of let it go and let others take others as players as captains and kind of let myself be a fan watching now,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-08,2023,225,1,1,1,next year i'm hearing some things that the schedule might be slightly more international if that is the case would you welcome that that liv becomes more of a world tour than it was the past two seasons,yeah i think that's going to be an obvious fit because liv has really taken over international golf and the u s has always been taken over by the pga tour but there are two things well there are things about liv that the pga tour don't have and one of them is control over a player's schedule which we have all given up in a sense because we've been justly compensated and the ability to move highest level professional golf throughout the world is going to be a very positive thing there's been increased demand every day so there are multiple countries that are wanting us to come play they like knowing what they're getting they like to know who's going to be coming it makes it easier for them to sell to the sponsors and to the fans as we continue to go global i feel like we're doing a good thing for the game of golf by bringing golf global sometimes we give a little bit myopic view here in the u s like the only thing that matters is u s golf and the fact is the greatest growth opportunities i think there's a hundred million golfers worldwide and million or more are outside the united states and we're able to bring the best level golf to many of those places,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-08,2023,203,1,1,1,we've been kind of the big framework agreement thing has been kind of floating out in the ether in the cloud someplace i know that you're a ways back a year and a half or so back one of your proposals or suggestions to the tour was to bring some team element into it i'm curious with however this framework agreement is going to unfold which obviously you guys don't know and we don't know monahan doesn't know whatever do you see eventually there being a team element and when you guys all what will be potentially your teams being part of a tour that includes liv and the pga tour is that something that you think should happen,i think there's two areas of professional golf that as you know i worked hard on and it wasn't going to happen until liv which was a team aspect and elevated events because the fans need to see the best players play against each other more often and until elevated events came the top players weren't playing in the same events they were broken up the team aspect brings a whole different way to identify to a younger crowd and i think the team aspect is a big reason why the demographic for liv golf is about half that of the pga tour and i think that's going to be crucial to the long term support of the game of golf as you know i worked very hard on both of those prior and it was made very clear that that was not going to come about unless because it was believed to be that liv wasn't going to happen now that it has happened those changes have been made but liv is leading the way in that area because we have the ability to guarantee who's going to be there and move this throughout the world as well as the team aspect,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-08,2023,50,1,1,1,what's your reaction been when you've seen how it's unfolded because really it's unfolded the way it was proposed to some degree in the first place to jay and whatnot and as you've seen the tour react to the success of liv what's been your reaction to that since you were in the belly of the beast from the start here,yeah so prior to this jay and i had four three or four hour meetings and all the notes i look back on i'd say or percent of them are happening and i think that's really cool and i'm happy for the pga tour i wish them all the best,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-06,2023,147,1,0,1,MODERATOR,i played here a long time ago but i have really fond memories here with seve i had a really special relationship with seve i looked up to him as a kid and i had a chance to play a pga tour event with him in san diego and he was so kind so me and i really appreciated the time i spent with him and there were a lot of great memories from his captaincy in ' even though we lost by a point made a good sunday rally the memories i had were of seve leading his team and driving around the course and getting involved in what his players should do and try this shot and how creative he was i had a lot of great memories but a lot of them are from valderrama and i can't come here without thinking about him,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-06,2023,80,0,1,1,MODERATOR,it's aspirational it's not for everybody but it's a cool thing about her team and it's the creativity of my wife amy and what she brings we envision a lot of little kids running around the golf course in capes and that's kind of what we're hoping for and have them dreaming about being a hyflyer one day i know we're only one year into liv but where it's going to be in years it's going to be pretty exciting,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-06,2023,150,1,0,1,MODERATOR,yeah it pretty much jump started my career when i was over here on the challenge tour my first win was at the end of in spain and i think that kind of propelled me the next six months on the challenge tour which got me european tour and then was able to make the leap over to the pga tour it basically jump started my entire career you always look back at your first professional win and to me that meant a lot i think it definitely plays a role in everything i've done and like i've said it a million times it was the most fun i've ever had playing golf was traveling the world those early years and learning a lot learning about myself learning different countries learning different things it was so much fun i think it played a huge part in who i am today,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-06,2023,205,0,1,1,MODERATOR,it's been a pretty full schedule to me relative to what i was expecting it to be at playing events this year with the four majors and the liv events and playing in saudi arabia earlier this year so it's been a lot of golf but it's been fun because there's been enough breaks in between to where i get excited to get back out here we were talking with our teammates about how much we were looking forward to getting out here and playing and playing practice rounds together and competing again so there's enough of a time off in between where we get excited to get out here this is really a fun month for us to be over here in europe we've got two incredible liv events here this week at valderrama and next week in london before a little break to prepare for the british open i'm expecting a lot of players that aren't in the british to qualify and then there's a lot of players here that will be competing this will be an exciting month for the liv players as we really make a push to the second half of our season and it's been a lot of fun,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-06,2023,75,1,1,1,brooks you're currently in third place on the individual standings but it's really anybody's game it's a really tight race right now given your career accomplishments where would a season individual trophy kind of rank amongst all of your career accomplishments,i agree with both of them i think it's been fantastic i think you can see the way the schedule has played out how everyone has played in majors phil second i got second at the masters good showing by a bunch of liv guys at the pga and then the u s open as well i think the schedule has been fantastic it's definitely helped us in the preparation for the majors as well,0
dustin johnson,1,2023-06,2023,53,0,1,1,brooks you won twice in spain in your early years what do you remember of those years and how important were they for your wins recently,same for me all the guys i talk to that have played here said nothing but great things so i was excited to get here and once i saw the golf course it lived up to everything that people said about it yeah it's a fantastic golf course really excited for the week,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-06,2023,161,0,1,1,we've got this week and next before the next major i was curious how you've enjoyed balancing the liv schedule with the major schedule especially with the few countries we've played in,i think it's really a credit to robert trent jones sr who designed it and the way he made precision be such an important part of the test of golf rather than the ability to just overpower it so this is a great example when we talk about the golf ball going too far and so forth of how to create precision and ball striking and course management as the challenge rather than just brute strength the simplicity of the golf course the greens they're not over contoured they have just the right amount of movement they're small they're difficult the way each holes are shaped with the trees and the fairways moving you really have to be creative on club selection as well as shot making it's just a great overall test and it's not just about who hits the ball the longest it's about who can have the most complete golf game and it's really a great golf course,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-06,2023,80,0,1,1,brooks dj has there been much of a difference than previous years from a scheduling standpoint,i've been pretty happy with my decision to be here at liv i've enjoyed it i'm not going to speak for everybody else but i would say everybody is pretty excited and everybody is pretty happy with where they're at right now it's tough to look into the future and say i don't have any control over what other guys do but i know i'm happy where i'm at right now and just take it one day at a time,0
dustin johnson,1,2023-06,2023,57,0,1,1,dj did you as captain order the code red on pat perez's hair,yeah i'm excited for the future i think with this agreement the only thing that's going to happen is liv is going to get even better than what it is now which it's already great i'm happy exactly where i am and i'm definitely not looking to play more golf than i'm playing now that's for sure,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-06,2023,89,0,1,1,how excited have you been that you are playing here in spain at valderrama,somewhat i think that right now we have basically an agreement to have an agreement so there's really and everything over the last couple of years that we've been told by greg and everybody on liv has come to fruition so we have a lot of confidence in what they have been saying to us because everything has been happening we don't really feel the need to publicly posture our position there's really no need for us to talk about things publicly but to just let it play out,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-06,2023,33,1,1,1,with the framework agreement that was announced at the beginning of the month it seems like most people presume that you guys want to return to the pga tour yet just hearing you talk about how you prepared for the majors and the way the season flows it's actually a much better way for you guys just actually wondering if you do want to return to the pga tour in some form of fashion,i think actions are a little bit stronger than words i think if you just look at what liv is doing and what we're doing i think that is more of a statement,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-06,2023,63,0,1,1,oddly most people think that liv is going to go away they thought this agreement basically said that but you're talking about capes you're talking about the future it seems like all of you believe that this is going to be around for a while,rather than saying yes or no i know that from a player experience all of the difficulties and challenges and things that take a lot of excessive energy and output throughout the week have been fixed at liv so the player experience here is incredible i just can't envision a better scenario for me as a player than playing out here on liv,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-06,2023,129,1,1,1,phil about your links to spain you've been a long time without coming here but you have a good relationship with seve sergio and jon have you ever talked to them about the miracle of spanish golf very little players having major winners have you talked to them about that,i would say i felt appreciation that we got to this point where we're working together because it makes me confident with where the game of golf is headed in the future we felt like it was going to be about two years roughly before we got to that point it took a year and a half or six months quicker than i thought it would be going forward we're all very optimistic about where the game of golf professional golf specifically is headed also a lot of the changes that have been made because of liv were all very appreciative both on the liv tour as well as the pga tour and we're happy for the guys out there that they're having some positive changes there as well,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-06,2023,69,1,1,1,phil specifically do you have any interest in playing on the pga tour in the future,it's tough to speak for the european side i think that's we don't really have any involvement in that considering that we're all from the united states so it's very tough i think to be honest with you it's kind of unfortunate what happened i don't know we'll see hopefully there's a couple guys from liv that are playing the ryder cup here in three months so we'll see,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-04,2023,209,0,1,1,MODERATOR,yeah it's going to all iron itself out because if you're one of the majors if you're the masters you're not looking at we should keep these guys out you're saying to yourself we want to have the best field we want to have the best players and these guys added a lot to the tournament this year at the masters how do we get them included we have to come up with a qualifying mechanism that is inclusive and if the world golf ranking isn't going to be inclusive then they have to find another way maybe they take the top or top or winners of liv but they're going to have to find a way to get the best liv players in their field if they want to have the best field in golf and be really what major championship is about so they're already looking at that if the world golf rankings doesn't find a way to be inclusive then the majors will just find another way to include liv because it's no longer a credible way so it will all iron itself out for the simple reason that it's in the best interest of everybody especially the tournaments the majors to have the best players,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-04,2023,241,0,1,1,james going back to working with phil and the guys what are some of the specific things that you have learned in your time working with these three guys,when the premier peter malinauskas took a leap and said we want the best players in the world and let's face it liv has some of the most characters some of the best players as well as some of the best characters in the game whether you love them or hate them they're interesting and people want to watch and he took a risk and said we want them to come here to adelaide and be a part of it and you saw what happened and then the cities in australia that initially kind of weren't interested now they are interested and want to bring it and i think we're seeing that not only in australia but other countries in the world where yeah we want to have the best players here we know who's going to be here that's a big asset that liv has being able to show and guarantee who's going to be there now a lot of other countries are wanting us to go there so it was a big step in adelaide in showcasing what it can be what liv golf can be and how much fun it can be and how much fun the people have with a different energy and vibe to professional golf and it's just going to take off from here there's no stopping liv golf now it's on a vertical trajectory and it's pretty exciting to be a part of it,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-04,2023,191,0,1,1,adelaide was so good for liv and for golf how can we replicate adelaide in all the tournaments going forward i know it will be difficult in a place like the u s given all the opposition but how can we replicate this model going forward,it is percent making me better and percent helping me get back to a level of play that i believe i can play at and i think i'm going to give myself quite a few chances now in some upcoming majors because my game is coming around my driving is getting significantly better my putting is getting significantly better and the areas of my game are getting much sharper although i haven't had the results for a long period of time it is on an upward trend and i'm looking to add to it this week with a stretch of a lot of golf coming up in the next three four months and a lot of great major championship opportunities with my game coming around i expect to participate and compete and contend in these events again i have a unique opportunity to do things in a game at a later point in life that many aren't because of the simple reason that i've kept myself in good shape i have been fairly injury free and i'm able to work and practice the necessary amount to play at a high level,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-04,2023,140,0,1,1,phil the first thing you said when you walked in here was about your admiration for lee kuan yew so obviously your country is thousands of miles away from america so how do you come to know of him and what made you interested in the things he's done,camo is a pretty easy one and then we've got riot or young master riot i like to call him and it's very fitting because he brings this energy this excitement when you first turn pro and you first come out everything is just amazing you just can't believe it and it keeps us young and it keeps us appreciative of the many great things of playing professional golf i look at the off season that camo had and it's remarkable the levels that he progressed with his game with his body physically and with the elements of his game in the last six months and then i look at the way steeley has just come right on to liv and has contended competed was in that playoff with danny lee and all of that is very motivating for me,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-04,2023,96,0,1,1,to all four brendan cam james and phil obviously it's only the second season of liv where do you see liv in years and what sort of legacy do you want to leave on this tour,i knew it was going to be a part of it you can't have change without disruption and i think in the end it will all work itself out and it's going to all be a really good thing in the long term but i'm very appreciative of what liv has provided for professional golf i've been a part of it for a number of years and i'm very acutely aware of a lot of things that go on behind the scenes and i'm appreciative of how liv has really helped change a lot of it,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-04,2023,77,0,1,1,just a fun follow up you're officially known as lefty and i've heard you called brendan man of what are these two guys' nicknames,i wouldn't say make a statement no it was an opportunity to play a major championship which we were all grateful for to be a part of it it was an opportunity to progress in my game and i took advantage of that opportunity and i'm looking to continue that like i did last week and this week and heading into this upcoming season here with three big major championships and the rest of the liv schedule,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-04,2023,103,0,1,1,just wanted to ask with all the criticism that liv has endured what did it mean to receive the kind of reception in adelaide and do you believe that maybe the mood towards liv is shifting now,yeah as people experience liv they are enjoying the different way of presenting golf in a much more fun vibrant energy now that people see what it can be they're wanting to be a part of it and it's just growing from there it was a big step to showcase what the potential is for liv throughout the world and we've had a lot of interest now from other countries other golf courses other cities that want to be a part of it because of that and now that they see the potential i think it's just going to take off even more,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-04,2023,127,1,0,1,MODERATOR,my game so i'm going to try to keep building on it and get better but the parts of my game have been really coming together for a while so i'm glad that i'm shooting some scores now again i'm looking forward to a pretty busy schedule my game is kind of coming around at the right time i've got this tournament i'm going to try to finish off and play a really good round tomorrow and then we're going to go to singapore and play and then come back to the states and have three weeks in a row with the pga championship right in the middle it's coming around at the right time and i'm going to keep working and trying to build on it,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-04,2023,85,0,1,1,tell us a little bit about your experience with the amazing aussie fans and the huge crowds we've been having here this really shows the blueprint for what liv can be tell us about this,yeah this is really an example of what is possible and a new opportunity to present golf in a different way and have a different energy and a different feel i'm not saying it should happen every week but what liv golf has provided is really a great alternative for the traditional ways of golf and the people here in australia have embraced it you see a whole different energy a whole different excitement and fun and i'm happy to be a part of it,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-04,2023,95,0,1,1,in an individual event the tournament would probably not have much drama tomorrow but because we have the team aspect there's still a lot of things that can move about can you talk about the importance of having that team competition going into a tournament like this where there is some drama tomorrow,it does make it a lot more fun and exciting and interesting this is a rarity to have after two rounds such a big lead by talor gooch that's some exceptional play to have a shot lead after two rounds that's almost unheard of it doesn't happen often i don't know if it's ever happened here on liv golf but the team aspect brings everybody together and when you're counting three scores you could have massive changes their team shot under par you can have huge changes a lot of teams are still in it,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-04,2023,104,0,1,1,i asked a similar question of cam smith but has this event exceeded your expectations here in australia,probably i knew that there were going to be a lot of people i didn't really understand fully how many people were going to be out here again what i am appreciative of is how kind everybody has been and how the comments have been fun or funny and positive so it's been fun to play in this environment the support that cam smith has had is pretty cool to see too i understand why he's so loved here in australia and we're certainly excited to have him on liv golf and be able to play in front of his hometown here in australia,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-04,2023,181,0,1,1,it's been two weeks almost since the masters that incredible performance on the last day at augusta can you talk about the reaction you've had since then leading into an event like this and playing so well the last couple of days too,it's been a nice momentum change for me because i really hadn't played the way i had wanted to last year and then i was playing really well starting this year and didn't have any results here on liv i felt like i had a good chance to play and compete at augusta but i had no real momentum or no real results prior to that then the final round things kind of clicked i hit a lot of good shots the first three days but it wasn't really quite coming together and it came together the final day it carried over at home i played great at home and played really well today too i didn't play as well as i wanted to yesterday but again it's a process winning is a process i'm starting to build back some momentum and it's at the right time because we have a lot of tournaments coming up and i feel like i'm just getting better each day and i'm looking forward to playing the way i know and believe i can play,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-04,2023,231,0,1,1,with some of the blows over the last two years to your reputation and image do you feel like this performance over these four days and the fans seeming to kind of warm to you a bit again do you feel like this is a step forward to kind of restoring some of the damage or whatever the right word is of the last two years and did you feel like you're,look i wouldn't look at it like that i'm very appreciative that we're here that we are able to play in the majors and i thought it was exciting that this tournament rose above it all to have the best players in the world here and lost all the pettiness that was great i'm happy where i'm at i wanted something different for a lot of reasons and i'm getting a lot out of it because having a team environment when i was in high school and college golf it elevated my game having players to play with compete with it brought a great energy and excitement and that's what this is doing for me at liv i'm not saying it's for everybody but it's been awesome for me and i love it i'm excited to go play in australia but i don't want to this shouldn't be this tournament isn't about what tour you play from there's players from all over all over the world on many different tours and you're bringing the best players to play against each other in the majors and that's what it's all about that's what the game of golf should be there's always going to be and should always be a place for historical events like this but it's okay to have a little bit of different and variety in the game of golf,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-04,2023,128,0,1,1,one follow up do you feel like kind of carrying the mantle for liv brooks was up there and you got in contention was there a little bit of competition with the other the guys from the other tour,yeah we're excited to go down there there's a lot of anticipation and we're looking forward to that at the end of this week i'm going to meet with some of my teammates and we're going to practice together before we head on a plane and get down there i'm looking forward to that i feel like this is way great week to give me a boost give me some confidence and give me some momentum to start playing and competing at a high level with my teammates i'm really looking forward to that too having a mixture of this style of golf old traditional historical majors and then have something a little bit different a different energy vibe it's been great for me i love the variety,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-04,2023,17,1,0,1,are you going to play the pga championship,did you go to stanford by any chance you have that sweatshirt somebody gave you that sweatshirt,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-04,2023,2,1,1,1,i'm not a pro media guy it's on behalf of fans from china we're just curious about a couple months ago there is a joke about from you about a match possible match between the pga tour and the liv guys like you right you said we're going to finish them right away is that a joke,thank you,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-04,2023,113,0,1,1,you were playing with brooks and have been around him over at liv what do you make of what he's done the last two days have you noticed anything out on the liv tour that you've seen from him,yeah he's been playing well he won last week he's had some momentum greens were difficult last week they were fast every bit as fast as this if not faster he had good touch on the greens you knew he was going to have a good week i'll bet the softness of the greens made him feel like he could be even more aggressive because they were softer and a little bit i don't want to say slower that's not a good word to use with these greens here but they were less fast they were not as fast as they played last week i'm sure he felt like he could be aggressive,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-04,2023,100,0,1,1,obviously your numbers have not been great of late over at liv is there anything about this that's rejuvenated you you've always talked about what it's like driving down magnolia you talked about the spiritual but in your game do you think this has ignited you a little bit how would you describe the last couple days,i'm going to go on a tear pretty soon you wouldn't think it you look at the scores but i've been playing exactly how i played yesterday hitting the ball great turning s s into s i'm ready to go on a tear i don't know why i'm playing well actually i do i've been putting in the work one of my teammates brendan steele has been helping me with the driver all he had to do was say the same thing that andrew has been saying but i listened to brendan a little bit more than i do andrew,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-04,2023,76,0,1,1,cam said yesterday that this was an important week for liv golf as a group do you agree with that,i thought he did a great job in his press conference i really enjoy being around him i don't know if that's the case or not i thought he said some really great things though he's probably right it would be nice to validate the amount of talent that is over there on liv and i think a lot of guys are playing really well heading in so i think it will be fun to watch,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-04,2023,61,1,1,1,obviously a big mix of successful liv guys and pga tour guys at the champions dinner tonight is there any message that you want to get across when you're talking to guys from different groups,no i think we all are we've had friendships relationships for a long time i don't see it being an issue i really don't i think that i think it's going to be a fun night to celebrate scottie's win and welcome him to a club that is truly unique and special and very an honor to be a part of,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-03,2023,58,0,1,1,how does it feel to be back in arizona you have a lot of history in this state winning your first amateur event here in tucson in and having gone to asu,yeah i really do enjoy the state of arizona but also tucson has been a great place for me it's where i won my first professional event in as an amateur and i have fond memories of coming back here to participate and bring live golf to tucson is exciting for me and everybody else involved with liv,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-03,2023,180,0,1,1,so the hyflyers has a new look and feel this year you have new team members talk about the rebranding of your team and what it's like to have brendan and james now,i could not be happier with our team and it's the chemistry and the way we have worked together and i think that there's an aspect of team golf that we are starting to see a little bit here that helps each other elevate and get the best out of each other the best example i can use is that in the last two weeks since méxico james and cameron who live in florida have been playing together and working and playing little short game competitions and steeley and i have been working back in san diego and he's been helping me a little bit with the driver and i've been helping him a little bit with short irons we are starting to get help each other get the best out of each other that's an aspect that we haven't really seen in professional golf because it's such an individual sport that either you don't feel comfortable asking or you don't want it share with the team dynamic i think we are going to help each other elevate our games,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-03,2023,139,1,1,1,the new structure on the pga tour what was your reaction listening to that how much is that because of liv golf's influence,you asked that as a question it should be more of a statement about the fingerprints and so forth i think that it's really a good thing i'm happy to see it i'm happy to see it for the tour i think there will always be a need and a want for traditional golf and there's always an opportunity to innovate and to allow liv to be additive and create something new and different for the going i also think the changes bring the best players about more often i think that's what fans want and what the sponsors want they want to know what they are buying and those are all things that liv have provided for their sponsors and television and so forth i think it's a good model to follow and i'm glad that they are,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-03,2023,115,0,1,1,there have been people who have said that if this happened a year ago you might not have liv golf,then i'm thankful it didn't happen a year ago i'm really happy with the way liv has brought about new change to the game because this team aspect is something that we really never saw as a possibility in golf until liv came along it brought about a new energy for me and a new dynamic and my teammates and myself are helping each other be our best that's been a lot of fun playing practice rounds with them and going to dinner hanging out it's brought a lot more joy to the professional golf experience and i'm really appreciative that it's come about so i'm glad that those changes didn't happen a year ago,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-03,2023,118,1,1,1,most players on the pga tour talk about majors and you used to talk about that all the time as well so how getting prepared for majors is liv going to be an impediment because you're focusing on your team so much that you won't be able to prepare for majors the same way,to bring the most value to your team you have to play your best and so you still have to put in the work and shoot low scores that's how you bring the value to your team as a player and so that's not going to change that will be the same whether it's in team golf or individual golf but the support system to help be your best is certainly a nice benefit we're all grateful that we're able to participate in the masters and all the majors because there was a lot of talk that that might not happen but here we are able to do that and we are all grateful for that as well,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-03,2023,80,0,1,1,do you also feel that liv it's not even a year so how do you feel the progress has gone and what do you see are the things that you still need to be working on,it has all happened so fast and everything got moved up a year because we had so much demand with so many top players coming over that we ended up moving the league and the team aspect up a year so there's a lot happening there's a lot of transition there's a lot of kind of figuring things out as we go but to think that we are where we are today in less than a year it's beyond amazing,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-03,2023,135,0,1,1,what are you missing what do you think needs to happen over the next year or two,evolution we'll just simply evolve and when we when we see something that can be better we have the fluidity to make the change and make it better i don't know i mean there's a lot of specifics that we could look at and say gosh do we need to go to holes to get world golf ranking points or what do we need to do to be the best product but really it comes down to we provide the he best product to fans to sponsors and also this is a question that liv has been asking that i haven't been asked in the last years how can we make this the best experience for the professionals as well and that's what's exciting for us as players to be a part of this league,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-03,2023,82,0,1,1,with the tv contract the ratings were fantastic what are your expectations with that,again it's one of those things that we are all grateful for because we were old oh well we're not going to have a tv deal well we have a tv deal with million homes and that's just in the us internationally we have a lot more exposure as well those relationships are really strong it will take some doing on our part on cw's part to get the word out that liv golf is on cw but that will slowly evolve,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-03,2023,162,0,1,1,did you have any influence on bringing liv to arizona,i would like to say that i had a direct impact on it it really wasn't we've tried to nail down some markets that have always wanted and supported professional golf and tucson has supported professional golf and then it got taken away a few decades ago granted i participated in a champions event we were here the champions tour was here a couple weeks ago i played a couple years ago but world class golf like the best players in the world the dustin johnsons and the cam smiths and brysons and brooks and so forth to bring that back to tucson i'm really proud to be a part of that even though it wasn't me just saying we've got to do this it was looking at it in general and saying this is really a good spot for us to be it would be great for the tour for the league it would be great for the area as well,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-03,2023,45,1,1,1,when the masters come up what are your expectations when the liv golfers go to augusta to compete with the pga,no expectations we are grateful to just be able to play and compete and be a part of it a lot of the people there that are playing and competing in the masters are friend for decades and i'm looking forward to seeing them again,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-03,2023,57,0,1,1,what is the significance of getting bryson and cam smith and those guys to join liv,it's massive it's another thing that i think everybody is grateful for because again we were told liv won't ever get the top players and gosh we have so many top players in the world that it's a quality product and it's something that we are all grateful for just another thing we are all grateful for,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-03,2023,188,1,1,1,the match play is going to be gone after next week on the pga tour could you see a scenario where you would fill the void here,it's a perfect format and opportunity to fill the match play void because the negative of the match play is that the most exciting days are earlier in the week and then the fans and sponsors only have one or two matches to follow on the weekend and the team aspect could make the match play much more exciting because you would always have three matches in the finals even if there were only two teams playing you could have six matches if you had the third and fourth team playing for third place and even if you have a blowout match you still would have to win two out of three matches and those other two matches would be coming down to the wire and create a lot of excitement so there's an opportunity with the team dynamic that liv golf could have a match play scenario it's certainly something that we are discussing as a possibility for the season ending event but we also want to make sure that we have enough golfers on the golf course which has been the knock on the match play,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-03,2023,75,0,1,1,why do you think liv came to tucson instead of phoenix,i think it's a great opportunity it's an opportunity to be in a market that is a golf market supportive of professional golf and hasn't had the highest level of golf in the world in a while and bring that back to to a community that deserves it so that's a big part of it plus the quality of golf courses the quality of the experience there's a lot of great reasons to be here,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-01,2023,195,0,1,1,you had a message for rory before the last round yesterday on twitter can you just give me your thoughts about that final round and the battle that he had with patrick reed and the appreciation for what patrick reed did given all that was going on around him,i think that when you have characters in the game when you have controversy in the game i think it creates a lot more excitement a lot more awareness what transpired early in the week with patrick and rory added to the excitement level i thought the final round was incredible both players played some great golf patrick played an incredible final round and rory didn't really have his best stuff throughout the day but he fought hard for the last two to win and i think that shows a lot about the kind of champion and player he is i thought it was great for the game to have that type of interest and it's been interest throughout the globe that's a really good thing in a couple of weeks i expect that the players the liv players will win their case in the uk and we'll open the doors for all players to play on the european tour there's a very good chance that you'll have more showdowns more head to head competitions like you saw last week in dubai and i think that would be a really good thing for the game,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-01,2023,254,1,1,1,you've talked about the majors and how the next three years gives you a very unique opportunity can you just talk about this year apart from augusta national the three golf courses you'll be go to for the majors and how are you planning those three weeks,so i'll use kind of a preparation that has i've had different preparations for majors that have worked in the past at kiawah i did not play the week before and i used that time to work on my game at home in the past i've played the week before i'll have a little bit of a mixture of both because of the schedule i'll play the week before the pga championship i'll play the week before the masters i'm looking forward to that i won't be playing the week before the u s open because we don't have a tournament the boston tournament got canceled what that does is give me a chance to go up to the course which is right where i live like it's la country club and play there i believe oak hill as well as la country club have been redesigned by gil hanse he does a wonderful job and i expect those courses to really showcase well with all the subtleties and nuances that are amazing in those courses and in his designs i look forward to getting back to royal liverpool and playing there too we've had some great champions there with tiger and rory winning the last couple of times and i've had a couple of decent performances there but i'm looking forward to playing well there too i like the golf courses for the majors obviously augusta is my favorite i think that's just a special place and i'm looking forward to getting back,0
phil mickelson,1,2022-10,2022,55,1,0,1,MODERATOR,let me just clarify that he doesn't have to pick from the last four he can pick from all seven teams so if you want a rematch of like the ' pga you could pick our team and we could play each other i'm just clarifying the rules because i don't know if everybody understands,0
phil mickelson,1,2022-10,2022,282,0,1,1,MODERATOR,from a team perspective this was a pretty easy decision for us because bernd and cameron play a very similar game they play a very similar golf ball and they look at the golf course the same way so this is going to keep them in their same element same strategy their caddies get along really well and are very close and i think that it's going to kind of lead to a cohesiveness and like a game plan our alternate shot foursome team was pretty easy to set especially when you look at matt wolff and how being one of the longest players on liv if not well bryson is out here but right behind bryson he's hitting the ball in places that we just don't see he's got so much firepower that when he gets in a groove and he gets it going we've seen throughout the liv events that he shoots some scores on some very challenging courses and this is one of them his length allows him to see this golf course totally different in a much more aggressive frame of mind i love his game for match play because he's going to be able to take advantage of a lot of the holes and make birdies get at some of these pins despite the water despite the challenges because he'll be coming at it with a much shorter club i really like him in singles and i really like bernd and cameron together and the cohesiveness that they provide then cameron smith and i will all naturally be irrelevant is the game plan like that's our plan but we are still going to play we'll still play,0
phil mickelson,1,2022-10,2022,151,0,1,1,phil you seem cautious to maybe not sledge or intimidate cam too much is there a reason behind that do you not want to wake the snake,well first of all what a great win he had last week he played some great golf i think it was an impressive victory but just maybe i shouldn't have said stuff like that i don't know but if i'm just looking at liv golf and where we are today to where we were six seven months ago and people are saying this is dead in the water and we're past that and here we are today a force in the game that's not going away that has players of this caliber that are moving professional golf throughout the world and the excitement level in the countries around the world of having some of the best players in the game of golf coming to their country and competing it's pretty remarkable how far liv golf has come in the last six seven months i don't think anybody can disagree with that,0
phil mickelson,1,2022-10,2022,111,1,1,1,phil a couple of weeks ago you said you saw liv trending upwards and pga tour trending downwards i'm not sure if you saw but rory mcilroy came out and said that that's just propaganda on your behalf can you speak to that,first of all those numbers can be very confusing for them what the range finders does is it really helps me because i don't have yardages on sprinklers from other fairways so when i get over there i have a much more committed swing because i know exactly how far it is otherwise we're trying to angle it it's just a lot of work to get yardages to one hole from two fairways let alone three and lasers just give me that freedom it's no coincidence that the first time lasers were ever allowed on the pga tour was the pga championship in look how that ended up it's no coincidence,0
brooks koepka,1,2022-10,2022,116,1,1,1,just a question for phil it's another one on the rory mcilroy interview in the guardian today he's spoken more generally about it and said this us versus them thing has gotten way out of control already and he's encouraging some level of kind of reconciliation i suppose i'm wondering from your perspective what that needs to look like and how this whole situation moves forward,yeah it's super nice to be able to drive an hour and minutes down the road and be able to get here i mean i don't know how many guys i'd say in this field there's probably that live in jupiter so it's convenient and i think a lot of us have just played it if you've grown up in florida playing junior golf tournaments or just playing it for fun and then obviously the pga tour was here for years played it quite a bit and feel comfortable but like you said it's nice to have family friends be able to come to an event when they don't get to see us play too much,0
phil mickelson,1,2022-10,2022,192,0,1,1,wondering what you're doing from a captaincy standpoint to kind of prep for miami and to build the chemistry for the team for the hy flyers,so we're pretty far down the list and we're not in a position to get a bye on friday so we're trying to use this week as let's get our game sharp we have a lot of good players we haven't put it together we need to build a little bit of momentum as we head into the final event of the year we'll have some time then to kind of regroup get ready for upcoming year and there's a lot of things internally that are happening within as we transition from liv to the league so there's a lot of things happening there but we have a chance here to gain a little bit of momentum play well on a golf course that's fun to play very similar to when we're going to be playing in doral try to build some momentum we have to play one extra day big deal let's go out and play well win our point and move on to the weekend i think that we have enough good players to do it we just have to just start playing the golf that we're capable of playing,0
phil mickelson,1,2022-10,2022,43,0,1,1,you made some comments about this country last year which you've apologized for i wondered how you feel about now you're here have you changed your opinion,so i will reiterate i never did an interview with alan shipnuck and i find that my experience with everybody associated with liv golf has been nothing but incredibly positive and i have the utmost respect for everybody that i've been involved with,0
phil mickelson,1,2022-10,2022,302,1,1,1,obviously when you were here last time things have changed a lot in the world of golf but this was sort of on the cusp of people's minds liv golf something was going to happen at that point what did you envision and how much is it different than maybe what you thought it might be,well it evolved a lot and will continue to evolve over time there were a lot of opportunities that were left open for somebody to come in and do this i think if you look back into the ' s what happened with cricket is probably the best analogy i think that as i said earlier for a long long time my years on the pga tour pretty much all the best players played on the pga tour at least for the last years that will never be the case again i think going forward you have to pick a side you have to pick what side do you think is going to be successful and i firmly believe that i'm on the winning side of how things are going to evolve and shape in the coming years for professional golf we play against a lot of the best players in the world on liv and there are a lot of the best players in the world on the pga tour and until some of the well until both sides sit down and have a conversation and work something out both sides are going to continue to change and evolve and i see liv golf trending upwards i see the pga tour trending downwards and i love the side that i'm on and i love how i feel i love how i'm reinvigorated and excited to play golf and compete i love the experience i love the way they treat us i love the way they involve us and listen to us in decisions i mean it's so inclusive it's so fluid that things liv golf is leading whether it's shorts whether it's other aspects of professional golf that are going to change and evolve those positions will be led by liv,0
phil mickelson,1,2022-10,2022,209,0,1,1,are you surprised at all given that there were some setbacks at the early point that they were able to pull it off to this degree in other words seventh tournament you're going to have an eighth they have all played out and in rather short order,i'm not surprised no i believe in the passion look the game of golf is very lucky to have the pif invest in the game the sport of the game of golf is being influxed with billions of dollars now and the ability to go global and make golf a truly global sport is really beneficial for the game now the united states and the u k are not favorable to this but everywhere outside of the world liv golf is loved and eventually they come around and they will be accepting of it but everywhere else in the world the ability to move these tournaments throughout the world and i've spoke with people that have had dealings that have not been positive with the tour and have had nothing but positive experience with liv it opens up opportunities to move professional golf throughout the world in other countries and grow the game internationally now again outside a few countries the united states and the u k where it's very negatively viewed currently that has been changing and evolving already and in time in a few years it will be not only accepted but appreciated the involvement and the influx of capital into this sport and what it's doing,0
phil mickelson,1,2022-10,2022,115,0,1,1,i wanted to you mentioned the world cricket league and i'm not a big expert but i think that cricket league ended up is not around anymore i think it ended up being subsumed by the bigger tours so what's to stop this happening to liv,the single game trials and again i'm i didn't grow up with cricket but i am becoming somewhat aware of what kerry packer did to evolve cricket and to pay professional cricket players a reasonable fee i mean i think they were making two hundred dollars a game back in the ' s and they weren't getting paid and there wasn't television rights and they were all having to have jobs and yet there was still money coming in and when kerry packer came and got involved and started page the guys and started paying them what they were worth and what they were bringing in it totally changed and we're seeing that happen now,0
phil mickelson,1,2022-10,2022,92,0,1,1,in sweden henrik stenson has received a massive criticism since he joined the liv tour and a few weeks ago the swedish golf association ended their cooperation and partnership with him how do you feel for him,i think that it's very shortsighted of the swedish golf association i think they're making a big mistake i think given all that henrik stenson has done to grow the game within the country of sweden from having his event and his partnership with annika and having events growing the game with kids putting capital through his foundation in the game i think it's shortsighted but also disrespectful for all that he's done for the game of golf i think in the end they're the ones that are going to look foolish,0
phil mickelson,1,2022-10,2022,137,0,1,1,today's pro am saw one of the saudi players doing really well do you think maybe in the future we'll see one saudi player in the liv invitationals,so the answer is yes i do believe that we will start to see some players from saudi arabia play on the liv tour saud is a great start when golf became an olympic sport we started to see a lot of money go into golf in countries like korea like china india parts of other parts of asia and today years later or so or however many years later years later we're starting to see many of those players make it on tour in professional golf i think that we are starting to see that investment in saudi golf and the young players from saudi arabia start to come up and in years time i think you're going to see a lot of players from this country on tours in professional golf both men and women,0
phil mickelson,1,2022-10,2022,57,0,1,1,can we please get your reaction to the news about liv and how you feel about world ranking points and what you think this means for liv and the development of liv,i think from a player standpoint it feels great to have everyone at liv fighting so hard for the players and their best interests i think for the world golf rankings this is a great way to keep its credibility while not bringing in politics into the decision making process i think it's good for all parties,0
phil mickelson,1,2022-10,2022,178,0,1,1,now that you're with liv golf how do you feel about the possibility down the road that liv golf will be played more here in asia pacific and the second part of the question do you feel that asia could potentially be one of the biggest fan bases for the team concept of liv golf and do you look forward to that,so i do agree with you that the team concept is very well received in this part of the world here in southeast asia i've also noticed a strong interest and appreciation for liv golf coming here and i've noticed that there are a lot of people flying in from other countries to be here and to be a part of this and watch i think that this area has wanted this level of professional golf for a long time and now that it's here i find everyone here is very appreciative the way that liv golf is being received here and welcomed and wanted in thailand and other countries here in southeast asia i think that there's a very good chance we'll have more events here and i think that's the strength of this organization is its ability to move throughout the world and bring golf at the highest level throughout the world grow the interest in the game of golf throughout the world and i would see that continuing to grow and develop even more here,0
phil mickelson,1,2022-10,2022,176,0,1,1,you're coming off your best round at liv golf how do you feel about your game and how do you feel about the hy flyers with two events left before miami,so my game has been starting to come around and chicago was a bit of a breakthrough for me where i was able to slow my mind down and let the game become easy again and start to hit good shots and not race not jump ahead but stay present i expect that i'll be able to continue that and continue to play well here i expect to have a good week i love the golf course our team is positioned to make a move the way we look at it is we have two opportunities to get past friday of doral so if we have to play in a match on friday we have to win the match to get to saturday or we can play really well these next two weeks get into the top four amongst the teams and get a bye through friday and only have to play saturday that's kind of the way we're looking at it it's our first of two opportunities to make it to the weekend at doral,0
phil mickelson,1,2022-10,2022,88,0,1,1,as a veteran how do you feel you can influence the game of golf and the younger generations coming up in future,so i'm trying to do that now in the partnership with liv and the ability to bring golf to other parts of the world other than the united states i think that the growth opportunity in the game is more global now and we're seeing the interest in other countries and we're seeing the opportunities in other countries and liv golf is in a great spot to capitalize on that and benefit from it but also give to those communities and help develop the game in other countries,0
phil mickelson,1,2022-10,2022,172,0,1,1,liv is expected to travel to sing pour next year and you've played in singapore and have many fans there can i get your thoughts about coming back to singapore,i really enjoyed the opportunity to play there i thought sentosa was a great golf course to host a world class event and i thought it was a very fascinating country i think lee kuan yew is one of the greatest leaders and the way he started that country and developed it i thought he's done some really great things where you don't have any natural resources to create one of the greatest harbors to have it be such a clean city and to create such wealth for all of their citizens i think he requires percent of every paycheck of your paycheck to go to your retirement account i think that he set up rules that you have to own and operate a business for years before you're able to get into politics i think he's created a pathway of success for that country and they've created a lot of wealth as well as a great quality of life for its citizens and i've enjoyed the time that i've been there,0
phil mickelson,1,2022-09,2022,92,0,1,1,MODERATOR,i mean the energy is different we all have a say everybody is being listened to we had a great players' meeting and they're listening to what everybody is saying and trying to make the best product if there's something we can improve on we make a change i love the feel of wearing shorts i think that kind of i know but it's consistent with what liv golf is all about it's making it it's updating the professional golf i think we're all enjoying the fan friendly and player friendly environment,0
phil mickelson,1,2022-09,2022,164,1,1,1,MODERATOR,the pga tour for the last or years have had all the best players in the world that will never be the case again liv golf is here to stay and this type of divisive talk is doing nobody good the best solution is for us to come together i think that the world of professional golf has a need for the old historical history of the game product that the pga tour provides and i think that liv provides a really cool updated feel that is attracting a lot younger crowd and that's being proven in the people that are watching and the age of the people that are watching i think both are needed for the game of golf both are good for the game of golf the inclusion of liv golf in the ecosystem of the golf world is necessary as soon as that happens and we all start working together that's going to be a really positive thing for everyone,0
cameron smith,1,2022-09,2022,5,1,0,1,i talked to kevin streelman a couple days ago he doesn't like what's going on and a lot of pga tour members don't like what's going on because they think that it's lessening the global competition across golf not all the best players are here and not all the best players are there and he's also upset about the lawsuit obviously because he feels like it's an affront to the pga tour members themselves can you just address those two things,i'm not answering that laughter,0
cameron smith,1,2022-09,2022,73,1,1,1,we feel really hurt that the pga has skipped us but we're so excited that liv is here and we hope you're coming back to rich harvest farms cam have you ever seen the movie joe dirt,i mean this is my second one i thought last week was great in boston i think there was probably a few more holes given the routing this week where there's a few more people standing around so i definitely felt that today i think that section around was fantastic i think there's a ton of people out here and i can't wait for the weekend i think it's going to be fantastic,0
phil mickelson,1,2022-09,2022,104,0,1,1,phil can you just talk about the happenings with the shorts and how happy you are,i mean i think this is a long time coming in the game of golf i think it just takes a disruptor like liv to get things done they've been leading in many ways and i'm very happy that they are leading in this particular area and i hope for the i have a lot of friends on tour and i hope for their sake the tour follows i think it's good for golf i think it's great for the players it feels good it's more comfortable especially when we start getting into some hot temperatures and i just think it's a great thing,0
phil mickelson,1,2022-09,2022,167,1,0,1,why is that,i just want it i want to compete i want to contribute to my team i want to get in contention i miss being in contention it's been over a year since i won the pga and i want to get back into that mix and that's what's fun next week i'm going to be working hard like today there was some good progress made but i've got to finish that round off i've got to shoot under par on that round the way i played instead i shot i've got to come out tomorrow and play a good solid round then next week i'm going to be grinding to get ready for chicago when i say it's not as far off as it looks it's because the shots are there i'm just mentally not playing as free because i'm trying to force it when i free up a little bit and relax and play loose like you're saying i'm going to get some good scores again,0
phil mickelson,1,2022-09,2022,243,0,1,1,you talked with si early in the week which i appreciated you talked about vindication talked about some regrets i wonder if there are any specifics you'd be comfortable sharing,i didn't say i felt vindicated i said i felt happy for the guys that they have a voice and they're being valued and they're being heard and changes are being implemented to show that appreciation because that hasn't been the case and it hasn't had to be the case because there was no other option and no leverage now they're being heard and things are changing so things have gotten better for everybody in professional golf and i believe for the fans too because they're seeing golf in a different environment with liv they're seeing on the tour the tour is bringing their best players together more often liv is moving professional golf throughout the world liv is adding a team aspect which is different they're adding a different viewership to watch golf without commercials and shot after shot i think the fans are getting a lot of benefit out of this and all golfers all professional golfers are getting a lot of benefit the guys on the tour are playing for a lot more money it's great that they magically found a couple hundred million that's awesome out on liv we have as players an incredible opportunity here to play for a lot of money and to be part of a team aspect and to really build this brand up and showcase it throughout the world everybody is i think in a better position now than they were a year ago,0
phil mickelson,1,2022-07,2022,383,0,1,1,patrick i know it's only been a few events you've been here but you seem a lot happier since you've made the jump what has that done to your game not only game but just are you as comfortable as you seem to everybody else now that you're with liv golf,i think the great thing about liv is that it's got the ability to adapt make adjustments and change things and make it better instantaneously i think that's a big thing the reason why i'm so high on liv golf is it addresses the two areas that for the years i've played the tour they have tried and struggled meaning liv has a chance to bring professional golf throughout the world players here when they sign up we receive a ton of money and we give up our schedule and we commit to wherever they hold the events we're going to go and we're going to be there and then they have the ability to move professional golf throughout the world i think that's a really big thing as we try to grow the game of golf throughout the world we might not feel it here in the united states but globally i think that's going to be a big impact the other thing is we as a game and sport the viewership has gone up five years to the average age i believe of and we have to target younger generation i think that the way that's going to happen is two things one it's not a hour day having to watch golf all day you've got a four and a half hour window second when i think a streaming partner comes about i think it's going to revolutionize the way golf is viewed because you'll have no commercials and you'll have shot after shot after shot and it will capture that younger generation's attention span we'll open up a lot of opportunities to get the younger generation which again for years we've tried to do and it's gone the other way i think liv golf addresses two really big areas and that's not even talking about the team aspect which is a whole intangible that is difficult for anybody to grasp but i notice how people like to identify with a team rather than just individuals and so that's a whole that's something i don't fully grasp how big that could be but that's in addition to those two main areas that i'm talking about that i think we're going to see a lot of benefits in the game because of,0
phil mickelson,1,2022-07,2022,156,0,1,1,patrick and phil how has liv kind of grown in the first couple events the league is obviously growing and moving very fast i'm curious what you guys have seen from a day to day tournament to tournament aspect what it's been like,oh eight months ago my wife we planned a trip for my wife's th birthday which was the end of may and we ended up spending a few days in a rwanda and then we went to tanzania but that video was just a random shot it looked like it was a preserve but one day out of a month the gorillas come out of a jungle there's like a wall there and they come out of the jungle and eat some of the eucalyptus trees for the salt and the stem and we were lucky enough to see them on that day because we had a much better view of the entire family amy is all excited because a little baby gorilla came up to her and kind of bumped into her she seems to have that effect on all animals they all come to her but it was a really special trip for us,0
phil mickelson,1,2022-07,2022,6,0,1,1,do you think we could see a winner from liv this week you said it was competitive,i didn't hear the first part,0
phil mickelson,1,2022-07,2022,15,0,1,1,do you think we could see a liv player winning this week you said the series is competitive,there's a lot of good players here i think there's a good chance thanks guys,0
phil mickelson,1,2022-06,2022,270,1,1,1,MODERATOR,well i wanted to say that it's nice to be back nice to see you guys it's been four months it's been a necessary time and an opportunity for me to step away a little bit and put a little bit of thought and reflection into going forward and how to best prioritize things it's given me an opportunity to spend time with amy to spend time with loved ones and continue some of the work therapy wise on some of the deficiencies that i have certainly as well as focus on best path forward it's been a positive time in that regard i know that many of you have strong well many people have strong opinions emotions about my choice to go forward with liv golf i understand and i respect that i'm incredibly grateful for the pga tour and the many opportunities it has provided me through the years but i am excited about this new opportunity as well i'm excited about being here in boston at the country club it's one of the five founding members of the usga it's got incredible rich history going back to francis ouimet it has provided me one of the most memorable moments of my career in the ' ryder cup and the comeback that we had and the fans here are some of the best in the world and they provide an atmosphere that is second to none for all sports golf is fortunate to be back and i'm excited to be back here and participate in this incredible championship that has eluded me for my whole career any questions,1
phil mickelson,1,2022-06,2022,96,1,1,1,yes there is how do you explain to them not to us but to them what you have decided to do,let's go back to one at a time i don't know what to say about the pga and their decision that's ultimately their decision i thought that it went really well at southern hills i thought it was a fun tournament to watch i thought it was exciting came down to the end and was exceptional but i don't get involved in that matter that's for the pga of america i haven't been involved in liv golf and their decision on where to hold their events but those discussions should be held privately behind closed doors,1
phil mickelson,1,2022-06,2022,54,1,1,1,how did you feel about the pga of america's decision to move the pga championship away from the trump course in bedminster to tulsa in the wake of the january th riots and then how do you feel about these two liv events being played on trump courses,i care more about the quality of the test of golf the quality of the golf course the fan experience and their ability to see and view the golf and the challenge of what the venue provides for the players risk reward exciting to see birdie opportunities tough pars i care more about that,1
phil mickelson,1,2022-06,2022,40,0,1,1,phil you mentioned earlier you have strong emotion or respect for people who have strong emotions opposing your decision to join liv golf you've obviously been one of the most popular players over the years among fans but if a segment of your fan base decided to walk away from you and not support you anymore would you respect and understand that decision and if so why and if not why not,in regards to if fans would leave or whatnot i respect and i understand their opinions and i understand that they have strong feelings and strong emotions regarding this choice and i certainly respect them respect that i respect that,1
phil mickelson,1,2022-06,2022,78,1,0,1,that was actually just one question,i have the utmost respect for the players on pga tour there have been a lot of friendships that have gone on for decades with amy and myself there have been a lot of memories that we've shared experiences that we've shared and many of the players on pga tour are people that i look up to and respect the most i think that i respect if they disagree but at this time this is the right decision,1
phil mickelson,1,2022-06,2022,180,1,1,1,just as a follow on to that the boston crowd can be pretty vociferous at times you were once adored by the american public a lot of them are now feeling pretty angry towards you if you do get booed and heckled this week will that hurt,so i'm going to try to answer i don't like it when you keep asking multiple questions but as far as legacy and i'll just address that i would say that i've been a part of the pga tour now for plus years and i have enjoyed my time i've enjoyed the opportunities it's provided i've enjoyed the lifestyle it's provided i've enjoyed the fact that the game of golf through the pga tour has been able to give me and my family so much i'm appreciative of that fact during that time i've worked really hard behind the scenes as well as on the scenes to try to contribute as a way of showing my appreciation and i've done the best i can to give back to it as well so i feel good about that i feel good about the efforts i put in to try to give back to the game of golf as well as the tour and i'm excited about the opportunity that liv golf presents for me and the game of golf going forward,1
phil mickelson,1,2022-06,2022,30,1,1,1,i'm curious what does legacy mean to you and do you think your legacy will change now that you're associated with liv golf,like i said i've done all i can to help contribute to the game contribute to the pga tour during my time with them and that's all i can do,1
phil mickelson,1,2022-06,2022,65,0,1,1,do you think that legacy may have changed or will change,let's just stop there so i think it's been pretty public that i'm suspended along with a bunch of other players so it would be only speculative going forward i am going to play the liv events i am going to play the british open but anything other than that would be pure speculation i don't know how this is all going to play out,1
phil mickelson,1,2022-06,2022,77,1,1,1,what are your plans playing wise beyond after this week in terms of anything do you hope to do anything beyond the liv events and the open championship and just as a follow do you feel like,my preference is to be able to choose which path i would like one or the other or both i feel that as i was saying to ann i gave as much back to the pga tour and the game of golf that i could throughout my years here and through my accomplishments on the course i've earned a lifetime membership i intend to keep that and then choose going forward which events to play and not,1
phil mickelson,1,2022-06,2022,98,1,1,1,just as a quick follow to that if it's your preference would you like to do both obviously the suspension notwithstanding at the moment is that your preference going forward if that comes to pass,the point of starting it up i'll have to defer to those at liv golf it was their idea it was their brain trust or child their thoughts and ideas that they brought to fruition i certainly respect rory i thought what a great finish yesterday and great accomplishment and what a career he has had i certainly respect him i respect his ideas i respect all the players that choose to stay on the pga tour i certainly think extremely highly of many of the players on the pga tour and their right to their own decisions,1
phil mickelson,1,2022-06,2022,19,0,1,1,the liv tour sort of drove a big wedge through the golf world with people being pretty passionate on both sides is that kind of the point of starting this up and have you had any dealings with guys like rory and the guys who are more passionate on the other side of the debate,amy liked it so as long as she likes it it's here when she says it's gone it's gone,1
phil mickelson,1,2022-06,2022,90,1,0,1,phil you're not the first professional athlete to deal with saudi arabia boxing horse racing motorsport the premier league u s government even deals with saudi arabia do you feel the criticism of yourself and others has been maybe unfairly harsh,in regards to the pga tour there's a lot of things throughout the years that the pga tour has done that i agree with and there's a lot of things that i don't agree with and yet i've supported them either way that's the way i feel going forward for other governing bodies as well and i'm going to try to keep any issues that i have again going forward behind closed doors because it was one of the biggest mistakes i've made is voicing all of these little things,1
phil mickelson,1,2022-06,2022,79,1,1,1,phil i'm curious about your reaction to the comments that the pga commissioner made over the weekend and no one has ever had to apologize for being on the pga tour do you feel you need to apologize for being on the liv tour,my relationship with callaway and specifically with chip brewer transcends just a sponsorship he is also a very good friend and somebody i look up to and respect my conversations with my partners that i have had longstanding relationships with as well as a number of potential new partners going forward that we've been in communication with will play out over time it's not high on my priority list right now and that stuff will play out in time,1
phil mickelson,1,2022-06,2022,44,0,1,1,phil your relationship with callaway was paused a few months ago have you been in contact or spoken recently with chip brewer and has that relationship changed now that you've officially gone on with the liv series,well like i said earlier multiple times today and last week i respect that everyone has their opinion and this is bringing out a lot of strong emotions for and against with a lot of people and i respect the opinions that everyone has,1
phil mickelson,1,2022-06,2022,45,1,1,1,phil what appeals to you about liv golf that you weren't getting from the pga tour,i've worked hard to earn a lifetime membership i've worked hard to give back to the pga tour and the game of golf throughout my plus years of professional golf and i've earned that lifetime membership so i believe that it should be my choice,1
phil mickelson,1,2022-06,2022,86,1,1,1,phil kind of as a follow to that i understand you have lifetime status but if you are so gung ho on liv golf going forward why do you still want to play on the pga tour,i believe there's a lot of things about liv golf that are transformative two specifically are a unique different format from a format that's been the same for half a century or more and i believe moving tournaments throughout the world and bringing that type of championship golf to different parts of the world is going to have a very positive effect globally on the sport and those are just two instances of areas i think liv will do a lot of good for the game,1
phil mickelson,1,2022-06,2022,118,1,1,1,phil you've talked about growing the game of golf and liv being good for golf are you at all worried that it's actually damaging the pga tour and professional golf in general,alex every day is not about what did i grow the game what it is is engaging people bringing people out to be exposed to the game i saw a lot of young kids out there under the age of or being exposed to professional golf it was an important part of my life going forward to be driven to have golf in my life play golf and then ultimately play professionally so i think the number of kids that were out there is just one area that could potentially grow the game by having those young ones involved but there's a lot more areas and ways that last week helped and i think it should be obvious,1
phil mickelson,1,2022-06,2022,39,1,0,1,you've mentioned a few times using the past four months to better yourself what specific areas did you need to address,i am again very appreciative of the many memories opportunities experiences friendships relationships pga tour has provided and those are going to last those will last a lifetime but i'm hopeful that i'll have a chance to create more,1
phil mickelson,1,2022-06,2022,56,1,0,1,are you at peace with the real possibility of never playing on the pga tour again,i think i speak for pretty much every american in that we feel the deepest of sympathy and the deepest of empathy for those that have lost loved ones friends in it affected all of us and those that have been directly affected i think i can't emphasize enough how much empathy i have for them,1
phil mickelson,1,2022-06,2022,34,1,0,1,phil would you like to write to the families personally it's not easy to address such an issue in public would you prefer to speak to them or write to them privately,last week i made it clear that all pga tour matters i'm going to i won't be discussing at this time and i believe those areas are areas that should be behind closed doors,1
phil mickelson,1,2022-06,2022,29,1,0,1,the fact that you were a lifetime member that wasn't brought up your reaction to that,i just got off the golf course and as i said yesterday in the press conference any pga tour matters i'm not going to discuss publicly at this time,1
phil mickelson,1,2022-06,2022,23,1,0,1,regards the suspension what happens now will you take legal advice,so anything regarding pga tour matters and i kind of put that in there i'm not ready to discuss publicly at this time,1
phil mickelson,1,2022-06,2022,20,1,1,1,what did you think about the statement from liv golf that suggested the pga tour are being vindictive in the decision they made today,so i should probably include liv golf in the pga tour matters that i won't be discussing at this time,1
phil mickelson,1,2022-06,2022,14,1,0,1,as a lifetime member of the pga tour did you ever think you would be banned,i feel like that kind of falls into pga tour matters laughter as well,1
phil mickelson,1,2022-06,2022,8,1,0,1,people are interested did you ever think that you would be banned from the pga tour,i'm very flattered so many people are interested,1
phil mickelson,1,2022-06,2022,54,0,1,1,with your contract are you going to play in all of the events now,so kind of two parts there yesterday i was kind of saying that i didn't feel contractual agreements should be public whether i like it or not so i'm not going to discuss it so to answer your question i'll be playing all the liv events i'll be participating in all the liv events,1
phil mickelson,1,2022-06,2022,108,0,1,1,MODERATOR,well certainly i've made said and done a lot of things that i regret and i'm sorry for that and for the hurt that it's caused a lot of people i don't i don't condone human rights violations at all i don't think nobody here is does throughout the world i'm certainly aware of what has happened with jamal khashoggi and i think it's terrible i've also seen the good that the game of golf has done throughout history and i believe that liv golf is going to do a lot of good for the game as well and i'm excited about this opportunity that's why i'm here,1
phil mickelson,1,2022-06,2022,69,0,1,1,MODERATOR,i said earlier i don't condone human rights violations i don't know how many i can be any more clear i understand your question but again i love this game of golf i've seen the good that it's done and i see the opportunity for liv golf to do a lot of good for the game throughout the world and i'm excited to be a part of this opportunity,1
phil mickelson,1,2022-06,2022,80,1,0,1,MODERATOR,i've really enjoyed my time on the pga tour i've had some incredible experiences some great memories and i have a lot of strong opinions on things that should and could be a lot better one of the mistakes i've made is voicing those publicly so i will i will really make an effort to keep those conversations behind closed doors going forward i think that's the way to be the most efficient and get the most out of it,1
phil mickelson,1,2022-06,2022,13,1,0,1,but isn't there a danger that you're also being seen as a tool of sportswashing an attempt to try and improve the image of a human rights abusing regime through sport and that ultimately you could be seen as a saudi stooge and that could tarnish your legacy are you comfortable with that,i choose not to speak publicly on pga tour issues at this time,1
phil mickelson,1,2022-06,2022,91,1,1,1,can you tell me if you served a ban or are serving a ban with the pga tour,there are the game of golf i've seen unify and bring people together and i love that i'm a part of this sport i love that this game has given me so much it is fun for me to give back and to bring this game on a global throughout the world on a global scale and the opportunities that liv golf provides i don't know how else i can say it i don't condone human rights violations nobody here does i don't know how else to say it anymore assertively,1
phil mickelson,1,2022-06,2022,178,0,1,1,you're talking about this being good for the game of golf the general perception is that this is all about the money money for the players can you comment on that what are your thoughts,i have had an awesome time i have had a four month break from the game that i have not had in over three decades i've had an opportunity to spend time with my wife amy a bunch and travel parts of the world and spend time at a place we have in montana skiing and hike in sedona what a beautiful place that is it's given me time to continue some of the work and therapy i've been working on in some areas that i've been deficient in my life it's given me time to reflect on what i want to do going forward or what's best for me what's best for the people i care about and this is an opportunity that allows me to still have golf in my life but also have a balance where i can be more present i can be more engaged with the people i really care about and that is that is why when i think about being a part of liv golf i feel so good about it,1
phil mickelson,1,2022-06,2022,161,1,0,1,a number of your tour colleagues have been critical of you can i ask how you have responded to some of those criticism and another one said that you had gone dark during your period,i have been a part of the tour for over years and i've had a lot of incredible memories that have been formed and experiences that i've shared tournaments that i've won and been a part of tournaments that i've lost and been a part of and also i've gained a lot i've received a lot from the pga tour and i'm grateful for that i'm grateful for everything the pga tour and the game of golf has provided for me and my family i've also worked really hard to contribute and try to build and add value to the tour during my time there and i worked really hard to earn a lifetime exemption and i i don't want to give that up i don't believe i should have to i don't know what that means for a future but i don't know what's going to happen but i've earned that and i don't plan on just giving it up,1
phil mickelson,1,2022-06,2022,212,0,1,1,my second question is it was said by one of your colleagues that you had gone dark whatever that means but what have you done for the last four months because no one's seen you,it came down to how i felt when i would think about playing again and amy and i were talking one day not too long ago about the possibilities or the options that we had and i found myself excited to play golf again when i talked about liv golf the team aspect the different format as well as the opportunity to have a little bit more balance i've played a lot of golf over the years and when i finally stepped away and took a break i realized that i needed to have a little bit i guess better balance i've said it a few times i just needed a little bit more balance on and off the golf course and this provide me a chance to bring golf back into my life but still do the things off the course i've wanted to do whether it's traveling spending time with people i care about i went to my nephews a couple of my nephews little league games i haven't had a chance to do that my whole life went to my niece's lacrosse games i haven't had a chance to do that it's given me opportunities like i say to have a better balance on and off the golf course,1
phil mickelson,1,2022-06,2022,44,1,1,1,do you feel you've got a future on the pga tour and do you even want one now,i understand that people may not agree with my decision to play liv golf my timing i understand that i empathize with that but this is what i think is the right decision for me amy the people i care about at this time,1
phil mickelson,1,2022-06,2022,12,1,1,1,sorry about the other guys that so much is focused on phil i wanted to ask if you were a young player now and not selected for liv is there a danger that this free agency world would create uncertainty reduce the value of pga rights you wouldn't have earned all you could do you wouldn't have had the opportunities and is that a risk that liv golf presents to golf more broadly than the chaos of free agency,i think i've addressed that about as thoroughly as i'm going to,1
phil mickelson,1,2022-06,2022,85,1,1,1,particularly on the shake up that liv golf is causing if you were a young player now and you weren't selected for liv golf is there a danger that in whole series would and still can do reduce the value of pga rights because free agency where you turn up to which events you would be at,every day of the masters i skied in the morning and i watched the tournament afterwards i enjoyed watching it i thought scottie scheffler put on an amazing performance there i found myself missing the masters but not wanting to be there i had not played i had not touched a club i wasn't in a position to be competitive but i will always love that tournament and if i'm not there i'll always miss it but i didn't have a desire to be there,1
phil mickelson,1,2022-06,2022,82,1,0,1,sure i follow i just want to ask on the decision did you consult any human rights violations groups and beyond khashoggi what are the human rights violations in particular you're referring to when you acknowledge those,just like the pga tour the ryder cup has provided so many special memories relationships friendships that have been formed those weeks that really have transcended and lasted a career and i'm hopeful to be a part of the ryder cup going forward but that's not the reason for me to maintain my membership it's because i've earned it i believe all players should have the right to play whenever and wherever they want which is consistent with being an independent contractor,1
phil mickelson,1,2022-06,2022,87,1,0,1,the other day you did mention that you didn't feel you were in a place to play the masters and the pga but just wondering in reflecting back obviously the opportunities for you are going to be less and certainly at augusta i'm sure you feel that's a place you can still win even into your s from that standpoint did it hurt to miss this time and did it make you reflect on the position that you put yourself in that you weren't there,it was made clear to me through extensive conversations that i was able to play if i wanted to i wasn't ready to play and compete i hadn't i hadn't practiced i had played a couple rounds but i wasn't sharp i feel like i was ready but it was made clear that i had the option to and i just chose not to and just like the masters i certainly enjoyed watching it i missed being there but i didn't have a desire to be there,1
phil mickelson,1,2022-06,2022,15,1,0,1,as you rightly said you've earned your lifetime membership to the pga tour is part of the desire to keep that membership related to the ryder cup at all are you still interested in being a captain somewhere down the line,that could be counterintuitive to what i just said about not talking about them publicly,1
phil mickelson,1,2022-06,2022,5,1,0,1,just to follow up on that were you surprised therefore to see the likes of dustin johnson sergio garcia etc have resigned from the pga tour,i'm learning from my mistakes,1
phil mickelson,1,2022-06,2022,26,1,0,1,how big a disappointment was it to you to not for whatever reason behind your decision to defend your pga title at southern hills,again that would be commenting on a pga tour matter i don't know what's going to happen but i'll deal with that with the tour privately,1
phil mickelson,1,2022-06,2022,8,1,0,1,secondly are you expecting to be punished by the pga tour for appearing at this tournament,i can't see who is speaking got it,1
phil mickelson,1,2022-06,2022,8,1,0,1,say you were to play at the u s open next week and actually win it how do you think that victory would be received compared to your win at the u s pga last year,i feel that contract agreements should be private,1
phil mickelson,1,2022-06,2022,35,1,0,1,just curious you wouldn't confirm or deny if you were banned or currently serving a ban is there a particular reason why you won't confirm that because presumably if you weren't banned you would just say so,if i were to confirm or deny or speak at all on that issue i would be speaking publicly on a pga tour matter which i don't i choose not to do at this time,1
phil mickelson,1,2022-02,2022,152,1,0,1,yesterday you played a practice round with bio kim and kevin na and othman a saudi player i think that is a brilliant moment in golf because it's a u s person and saudi person and korean in there how about that time and what does that mean to you,i love the way golf is becoming more global and the level of play throughout the world is increasing we're seeing some really high level players come from so many different parts of the world now it was fun for me to play yesterday kevin and i were able to play like a little match with bio and othman and we had a really fun time it's obviously fun when you get to win and collect too but i really enjoyed spending time with them kevin is a good person i have a lot of great memories being around kevin and his caddie kenny and we've had some fun moments i played a practice round with him at the pga a lot of good vibes so we had a lot of fun yesterday it is interesting to see how many people from all over the world how this game brings people together,0
phil mickelson,1,2022-02,2022,171,1,1,1,i just wanted to ask you you've had so many great victories in your career pga championship the open masters how impressed were with winning the pip i ask you because you were one of the you could have been on social media and other things for a long time you have the flair for it as we all know but you just took your time you came on to it maybe just about a year ago why so late and does that mean more to you that you came so late and yet you're just dominating like in golf,i did not understand what a powerful tool social media is i didn't understand how it could unify and bring people closer together and show others glimpses into different sides of life as i've gotten on to social media and i've followed other people i've gotten to see different viewpoints on small parts of their lives and it's been interesting and then to share that as well has been interesting but what i didn't understand was how powerful of a tool it is to bring people together and unify and share fun moments and entertain it took me a while to really grasp that it's been a really good thing because it allows a player like myself now to share something directly with an individual with fans what have you as opposed to have to have an intermediary where sometimes the message can be distorted or not as clear as if it came direct from someone it's a very powerful tool i just wasn't smart enough to grasp it early on,0
phil mickelson,1,2022-02,2022,57,1,0,1,please tell me a general comment on the golf saudi activity right now,i think as a player we're very appreciative of the support that they have shown in supporting the let and the lpga as well as creating some leverage for players to have a leg to stand on and try to make the work environment better on the pga tour and we're very appreciative of everything they've done,0
phil mickelson,1,2022-02,2022,195,1,0,1,as well as investing heavily obviously in the asian tour golf saudi we understand have ambitions for a possible different circuit a super golf league lee westwood and dustin johnson talked a little bit about that this morning in their press conferences can you give us the latest from your point of view whether you think it's a good concept whether you've been approached whatever you can tell us about it please,i think everybody is looking at it and seeing parts of it that can really help and benefit their situation their life their career and then there's parts of it that they're probably concerned with i'm appreciative of the fact that there is competition and that leverage has allowed for a much better environment on the pga tour meaning we would not have an incentive programme like the pip for the top players without this type of competition we would not have the increase in the fedexcup money we would not have the increase in the players championship to million this year if it wasn't for this threat it was projected to get there in a couple years to have a season long payout for the top guys on the fedexcup list came about last year for the first time at million it's going to double to i think and that wouldn't be around i'm appreciative of the competition and what my hopes are is that the biggest thing which are media rights and the way the players have been used for so long i hope that that changes through the competitive opportunity as well,0
phil mickelson,1,2022-01,2022,92,1,0,1,you're in this field after winning the pga championship last year what inspires you at this point of your career to maybe get a return trip back here in,i love the challenge and i had some really good things this last couple of months in the off season or last few months as i got ready for this upcoming season and i think that i'm going to play some good golf so i'm having fun i'm enjoying the challenge i'm enjoying playing competing and i've had a couple of little really mini breakthroughs in my game and i'm hopeful to put it to use and score that's the ultimately the bottom line you just got to go shoot a number,0
phil mickelson,1,2021-08,2021,18,1,0,1,that wasn't the first time you'd played,no i played it the day before the pga in ' so i have some good karma there,0
phil mickelson,1,2021-06,2021,153,1,0,1,you've obviously been pretty busy since the pga colonial and then trying to get prepared for the u s open have you had much time to reflect on what you were able to accomplish there and kind of what it means for the history,probably not fully but enough there's some opportunities coming up with the way i've been playing that i'm optimistic that i can compete and contend there's nothing more fun for me than to be in it on the weekend i've actually been playing well enough to have chances and we have some good tournaments coming up the next couple of months afterwards and i'll look back and reminisce when the season's over and i have some time in the off season to not need to work on my game and i'll still have that wanamaker trophy i'll be looking at and i'm still looking to add a friend to it along the line that win was very meaningful to me because i've been putting in a lot of work the last couple years and getting nothing out of it and so to have a moment like that is something that makes it worthwhile,0
phil mickelson,1,2021-06,2021,78,1,0,1,you kind of touched on it but what is the approach next,i know i'm playing a little bit better but i just kind of lost it on thursday and today i know that i've been playing well and i'm going to go to the range and try to find it and go have a good round tomorrow then i'll play the next two weeks in hartford and detroit and try to add to the momentum i created at the pga and see if i can continue that good play,0
phil mickelson,1,2021-06,2021,43,1,0,1,do you feel like your expectations have changed after the pga win and is that something you consciously deal with one way or the other,i don't think my expectations have changed but i feel like i have the confidence and ability to play well enough to get in contention and so i guess my disappointment when i don't play to that level is a little bit greater,0
phil mickelson,1,2021-06,2021,131,1,0,1,phil tim spoke about just the self belief you had before the pga when you win a tournament like that you have that kind of confirmed how much more does that grow after that,it's a big thing it's one thing when you are playing at a certain level but not getting the results it's very frustrating and it's tough to be patient but when you know that you're playing at a certain level and you are patient and it finally does click like it did at the pga i felt like i had been playing at that level for a couple of months but i wasn't getting it out then when it all comes together at a perfect time like that was exciting to put it together i feel like or i'm hopeful that some of the things that i had learned heading in will carry over and give me some more opportunities this summer because i feel like i'm playing some good golf,0
phil mickelson,1,2021-06,2021,138,1,0,1,the tweet you had before the tournament about accepting failure really kind of took off after that and seemed to resonate with a lot of people i was curious what your reaction was to seeing that after the fact,well it's challenging when like i was saying when you continue to work hard do the right things and see the progress but not get the results it's very frustrating and a lot of times people will stop or quit because they're just not getting out of it what they feel they're putting into it but you kind of learn in plateaus and every now and then you might be working hard working hard doing the right things and not getting the progress and then you kind of get a spike that spike came at the pga to where it all kind of comes together and you put it all together it was at the right time hopefully i'll continue to play at a new plateau at a little bit higher level because some things started to click,0
phil mickelson,1,2021-05,2021,14,1,0,1,obviously you had said you wanted to come here and build off the momentum i know this isn't quite the day you wanted talk about today and how difficult it was,yeah i didn't play well i shot over but i won the pga so,0
phil mickelson,1,2021-05,2021,190,1,0,1,obviously the conditions out there just talk about how that played into it,very fair very playable golf course with the wind because the greens are receptive i thought it was a day that you could score low i mean obviously jordan played phenomenal golf and shot under but i mean score like shoot under with i didn't think too much difficulty but not the way i played i missed fairways with irons you can't play this course out of the rough because then you have tree trouble which i had repeatedly and i didn't putt well but i won the pga so i'll see if i can get it turned around for tomorrow and get a little better focus a little better energy i was a little bit i don't know if it was antsy or what but it just wasn't the same kind of calm and kind of a lot went on the last couple of days in a good way and i'll have some time tonight tomorrow to get settled in and hopefully i'll come back and play a good round i know even though i didn't play well today my game is not far off i've been playing well,0
phil mickelson,1,2021-05,2021,166,1,0,1,and then guys who haven't won in a while such as jordan did you gain any inspiration from any of those,absolutely and seeing the way jordan spieth has come back and seeing how hard he's worked and not getting the results that he wanted for a while and then being patient and working and working and continuing to do the right things and then his game comes back and he's playing consistently now at the highest level every week and he's had a huge win i think that every player goes through challenges we saw it on the lpga with lydia ko after struggling for a little while dominating and struggling a little bit for her to come back and play as well as she has like that's an inspiration stewart cink was a huge won too he won twice this year at napa and hilton head i had a chance to play with him at charlotte and he's striking it so good hitting the ball long and straight and having a lot of fun there with reagan at his side very inspiring person right there,0
phil mickelson,1,2021-05,2021,181,1,0,1,you were speaking about what you do eating wise but mentally after such a huge week how do you turn to this week to try to do it again,so that's going to be a difficult challenge obviously that's going to be the biggest challenge for me because i kind of went from keeping my mind off of all the distractions and the noise during the week of the pga to really letting it come in the last two days enjoy it and really it hit me in the last two days what just happened because when i'm doing it i'm not fully aware because i'm so in the moment but that night hanging out with amy seeing it seeing some of the highlights thinking wow this really happened and now it's wednesday and it's time to get off of social media and get back on the practice range and start to refocus and start to get my mind quiet again and get rid of the distractions and get back in the present so that's going to be a challenge it's not easy for me to do but last week i was able to acquire the skills to do that and i'm hoping that i can keep doing that more,0
phil mickelson,1,2021-05,2021,117,1,0,1,it has been an incredible week with a sunday we will never forget please help me in welcoming the senior vice president of troon and the president of the pga of america jim richerson jim the floor is yours,i want to thank everybody for coming out and supporting us players the way you have it's just been an incredible environment i've got to thank a few people and my wife is first on the list because without her love and support i wouldn't be here and i can't wait to get back and see her tonight my brother tim what a great job he did this week and i am just so appreciative of having him on the bag and being able to share this incredible experience andrew getson who's taken me from not swinging well to swinging pretty good just really appreciate all the hard work he's put in to helping me achieve this,0
phil mickelson,1,2021-05,2021,144,1,0,1,we've watched you transform your body over the years you have talked this week about transforming your mind in terms of focus you already have a hall of fame career what is it in you that continues to chase greatness and execute the way that you just did today,i just love this game of golf and i love what i do and i love the challenge of competing against such great players i mean what an incredible competitor and tough player brooks koepka is and to have a chance to play in the final group with him was an exceptional honor it's been really fun for me to see his development i remember playing a practice round with him in at oak hill pga championship first time we ever played together and seeing the way his game has developed and what a tough player he is it was a really difficult task for me to go head to head and come out on top and i'm appreciative of the opportunity for you where does this accomplishment rank and where do these fans rank in terms of what you've experienced over your career,0
phil mickelson,1,2021-04,2021,8,1,0,1,you're planning to play next week wells fargo what else is on the calendar,i'll play there and the pga for sure,0
phil mickelson,1,2021-04,2021,86,1,0,1,i was thinking of mark's question from the other day about champions tour versus pga tour of the pga tour events is this the one maybe you're best still suited to win or contend or mean the most anything different just about this particular stop,no it's not so much the tournament the venue it's just putting it together and scoring it's just hitting the shots making the putts and shooting the low scores it's just not a hard formula i'm hitting the shots i'm just not putting it all together hit a great little wedge into carve it around the bunker six feet uphill and i just miss it like it just takes momentum out those little things i've got to start doing the little things a little bit better,0
phil mickelson,1,2021-04,2021,113,0,1,1,sometimes you have a dream of being you dreamed of being here and it doesn't quite live up to your expectations did this even surpass your dreams of what this would be like to play here,i'm really not knowledgeable on state laws across the united states and all the laws that we have i'm aware of some from california that we have and we tend to be the leader in a lot of that area as far as human rights civil rights diversity and so forth and i'm proud of that and hopefully as a californian although i'll be moving soon we lead by example so i'm not really familiar with the details of what all you're talking about but i do believe in the rights and treating all people equal and i hope that as a californian we lead by example and that others will follow suit,0
phil mickelson,1,2021-04,2021,163,0,1,1,do you think there was any sense of making sure it was more difficult based on dj shooting under a tournament record i realize it was november and different,when i was a kid i grew up dreaming of winning the masters and being a part of the history here and watching seve ballesteros win in the early ' s twice and pumping his fist and the charisma like it was my dream to win here to be a part of the history here and the way now that i have won and i'm part of the history the way that i get treated here is second to none i'm just very appreciative of the way they've treated me years ago i made a statement tax wise california big mistake got into politics not going to do it again i have my beliefs and i'm going to live my life according to those beliefs and i'm going to try to treat people the right way and you know without discrimination that's the best i can do is lead by example but i'm not going to get into politics it never goes well,0
phil mickelson,1,2021-03,2021,19,1,0,1,priority to win again on the pga tour and even be the oldest winner is that in your head at all,no my motivation is more of an intrinsic motivation where i just enjoy it because i enjoy a challenge,0
phil mickelson,1,2021-02,2021,4,1,0,1,the pga tour and european tour about been against changes to the equipment because they feel the product that's presented is a good product and they don't want to change that product do you feel the same way,it's not i wasn't,0
phil mickelson,1,2021-01,2021,177,1,0,1,MODERATOR,well i only wear masks from places i've won multiple events and that doesn't rule out amex actually here so you might see me in one of those masks i am appreciative that we had a chance to play and compete in the masters and many tournaments last year with this pandemic still going on i'm appreciative of the growth of the game of golf and the boom we have had in participation i'm appreciative that people have been able to play golf and be safe and the efforts made by the pga tour and by the staff volunteers it has not been easy and yet we have been able to keep golf at the forefront and give some people entertainment at home i'm appreciative to be a part of that and i'm sorry that we're continuing to go to these measures into this year but it looks like there's an end in site soon and i'm appreciative of all the companies that have worked so hard to get a vaccine out as soon as they have,0
phil mickelson,1,2021-01,2021,198,1,0,1,MODERATOR,so my love of the game of golf is extremely high and my desire to compete and play against the best players is high and so i find myself just internally motivated because of my love to compete and my love to try to bring out the best in me so i've actually had a good off season where i haven't had as much time off as i normally would take because it's been so much shorter i feel like i've made a few good strides and i'm excited to start the year and see if i'm able to continue playing at the highest level if i am i'm going to really try to play more events on the pga tour and make a push hopefully for the ryder cup but if i don't play well early on i'll start to re evaluate things and maybe play a few more events on the champions tour because what's fun for me is competing getting in contention and trying to win tournaments but i've made some strides in my game i'm excited to start the year and see if i can play at the highest level like i expect to,0
phil mickelson,1,2021-01,2021,383,1,0,1,the question was and thank you for the compliment i'm quite flattered is after all you've accomplished in your career how do you get excited and motivated for a new year,so i played two events last year and i had some success winning both but what i really enjoyed was the ability to play compete be in contention and to play against guys that i have known for plus years and compete against them again and see a lot of friends that i haven't seen in a long time and golf courses that are more fun to play and are not built to beat you up the way a lot of pga tour courses are and rightfully so the pga tour courses and the setups are designed to challenge the best players in the world and so you're going to have more difficult setups and pin placements and so forth but it was fun for me to play in the champions events where they were set up a little bit more like the s when i first came out on tour and i could play much more aggressive i was able to get up and down from some of the short sides and it didn't feel as tricked up and so i really enjoyed that and it has me looking at it a little bit differently as though the enjoyment i get out of the game of golf is to play and compete have opportunities to win go for it try to make birdies and play aggressive the champions tour allowed me to do all of that and so i certainly am looking at that however it's the ability to play and compete against the best in the world that gets me in the gym every morning at or that gets me on the range working on my game on the putting green working on my putting that challenge of trying to play and compete against the best is what really drives me and so i need to have that or else i feel i might get complacent so i'm trying to find the right balance but right now my goal is to play at the highest level and play against the best and if i can compete week in and week out again at the best and it's been a few years since i've had that level of consistency but if i'm able to do that that's what i want to do,0
phil mickelson,1,2020-11,2020,228,0,1,1,MODERATOR,so it's been years and yet i feel i still remember it well because of the memories that stay with you the first time that you come here because you don't know if it's going to be the last time you come here so you really take it in and i just rememberâ€‘â€‘ well there's a lot of things i remember but the ability to stay on the grounds and to walk right down below and have the champions locker room right there i snuck in there sure you know gene sarazen was still around and i saw his locker and some of the greats from the era that i didn't even see guys play from byron nelson and sam snead they were alive when i was playing there and they were there at the champions dinner and you could hear them down below when they were congregating this club is so much more than a tournament because it gives kids like myself when i was a kid and kids of all ages something to aspire to and dream of the ability to spend time with hang around and be a part of the champions from the past meant a lot to me then and i think it's one of the great traditions now this club this tournament treats past champions better than any tournament in the world,0
phil mickelson,1,2022-10,2022,55,1,0,1,MODERATOR,let me just clarify that he doesn't have to pick from the last four he can pick from all seven teams so if you want a rematch of like the ' pga you could pick our team and we could play each other i'm just clarifying the rules because i don't know if everybody understands,0
phil mickelson,1,2022-10,2022,282,0,1,1,MODERATOR,from a team perspective this was a pretty easy decision for us because bernd and cameron play a very similar game they play a very similar golf ball and they look at the golf course the same way so this is going to keep them in their same element same strategy their caddies get along really well and are very close and i think that it's going to kind of lead to a cohesiveness and like a game plan our alternate shot foursome team was pretty easy to set especially when you look at matt wolff and how being one of the longest players on liv if not well bryson is out here but right behind bryson he's hitting the ball in places that we just don't see he's got so much firepower that when he gets in a groove and he gets it going we've seen throughout the liv events that he shoots some scores on some very challenging courses and this is one of them his length allows him to see this golf course totally different in a much more aggressive frame of mind i love his game for match play because he's going to be able to take advantage of a lot of the holes and make birdies get at some of these pins despite the water despite the challenges because he'll be coming at it with a much shorter club i really like him in singles and i really like bernd and cameron together and the cohesiveness that they provide then cameron smith and i will all naturally be irrelevant is the game plan like that's our plan but we are still going to play we'll still play,0
phil mickelson,1,2022-10,2022,151,0,1,1,phil you seem cautious to maybe not sledge or intimidate cam too much is there a reason behind that do you not want to wake the snake,well first of all what a great win he had last week he played some great golf i think it was an impressive victory but just maybe i shouldn't have said stuff like that i don't know but if i'm just looking at liv golf and where we are today to where we were six seven months ago and people are saying this is dead in the water and we're past that and here we are today a force in the game that's not going away that has players of this caliber that are moving professional golf throughout the world and the excitement level in the countries around the world of having some of the best players in the game of golf coming to their country and competing it's pretty remarkable how far liv golf has come in the last six seven months i don't think anybody can disagree with that,0
phil mickelson,1,2022-10,2022,111,1,1,1,phil a couple of weeks ago you said you saw liv trending upwards and pga tour trending downwards i'm not sure if you saw but rory mcilroy came out and said that that's just propaganda on your behalf can you speak to that,first of all those numbers can be very confusing for them what the range finders does is it really helps me because i don't have yardages on sprinklers from other fairways so when i get over there i have a much more committed swing because i know exactly how far it is otherwise we're trying to angle it it's just a lot of work to get yardages to one hole from two fairways let alone three and lasers just give me that freedom it's no coincidence that the first time lasers were ever allowed on the pga tour was the pga championship in look how that ended up it's no coincidence,0
brooks koepka,1,2022-10,2022,116,1,1,1,just a question for phil it's another one on the rory mcilroy interview in the guardian today he's spoken more generally about it and said this us versus them thing has gotten way out of control already and he's encouraging some level of kind of reconciliation i suppose i'm wondering from your perspective what that needs to look like and how this whole situation moves forward,yeah it's super nice to be able to drive an hour and minutes down the road and be able to get here i mean i don't know how many guys i'd say in this field there's probably that live in jupiter so it's convenient and i think a lot of us have just played it if you've grown up in florida playing junior golf tournaments or just playing it for fun and then obviously the pga tour was here for years played it quite a bit and feel comfortable but like you said it's nice to have family friends be able to come to an event when they don't get to see us play too much,0
brooks koepka,1,2024-02,2024,135,0,1,1,graeme and talor basically you guys are the new additions to the team what are your ambitions what are your hopes what are you trying to achieve here at smash,obviously i think if you look at the group of guys that are here just as part of this league is what's going to draw kids i'm pretty sure that's how each one of us got involved you find your idol or a guy you like and you follow them and continue to watch them throughout the year or you come out and you get a chance to see them live and you come out and you fall in love with the game and you fall in love with a guy and you get to play a golf course that we've played i think that's pretty special and i think you can see the involvement since i first came here in i think a lot more kids are getting involved so that's a good thing,0
brooks koepka,1,2024-02,2024,194,0,1,1,brooks in terms of the liv jeddah tournament being held here year after year how do you think this is going to be more beneficial to the community how can the kids here pick up the sport more,i think it's pretty simple like talor said we wanted to put a group of guys that first off know how to win i think that's important you've got to be able to cross that finish line you've got guys that have been in those spots won major championships guys that are going to compete for them for years and years and guys that aren't afraid i think that's a huge thing you look at this whole team and i don't think anybody is going to back down they've got a chance to if they've got a chance to win they're going to put their foot on the pedal and go that's what we want it's also just a very easy group of guys to be around sitting around even for lunch just talking about random stuff life whatever it is i feel like we're all very close i've gotten with j over the last four of five years i've known g mac for years now been pretty close talor obviously just getting to know him even better more recently it's been the perfect addition i'm beyond thrilled and i'm happy to have them,0
sergio garcia,1,2023-04,2023,118,0,1,1,MODERATOR,oh i mean obviously some of the memories definitely help but at the end of the day i think that every tournament is a different story the course is playing similar to when we played it here on the singapore open but maybe a little bit longer a couple tees that we didn't use there so it definitely makes a little bit of a difference but obviously you know that if you want to contend on a liv tournament you have to raise your level as much as possible because all of these guys can play can really play the game and obviously it's going to be another hopefully another fun day and a good battle out there,0
sergio garcia,1,2023-04,2023,80,0,1,1,talor i think this is the th time that you've led or co led after a round here at liv with each of those leads are you getting more and more is it a comfort level or what is the experience as you keep stacking those leads,oh yeah for sure obviously that's why we are here that's why we practice at home and work hard to give ourselves chances obviously i've had in the last year here on liv i've probably had two or three decent chances at winning i haven't been able to do it yet but the only thing you can do is keep working hard at it keep putting yourself in this situation like talor said and just wait for the right moment,0
sergio garcia,1,2023-04,2023,5,0,1,1,first win on liv,that was a tough one,0
sergio garcia,1,2023-04,2023,5,0,1,1,sergio i wanted to get your thoughts on the recent arbitration ruling that went not in favor of liv golf,the one with dp world,0
sergio garcia,1,2023-04,2023,177,0,1,1,sergio it's your second year on liv and obviously it's a league that's growing in stature i want to ask where do you see liv in years and what kind of legacy do you want to leave in liv golf,well i mean i love the way i think i speak for everyone i love the way that liv is shaping up and the way that the direction is headed at so we're all super excited about it i think one of the best things about liv is that they're always asking for our input and our advice so that's great at the end of the day we're trying to play as well as we can enjoy our teammates grow the game as much as possible make sure that the average on when it comes on to golf comes down as much as possible because at the end of the day what you want is it's for your sport to be young and obviously all the older people that play it's great but we the most important thing is to have young guys that are going to carry that game for a long time so i think that liv is liv and us obviously we're proving that we can do that and we're very proud of that,0
dustin johnson,1,2022-10,2022,82,0,1,1,pat before the season started you and i met and i interviewed you and you told me off mic a conversation you had with dj before you joined would you mind to disclose that now,just look at what happened today obviously yeah it was a team effort but coming down the th hole it ended up coming down to me and cam playing the th hole to see who wins the team championship you couldn't have drawn it up any better but i think that's what liv is look at all the fans look how much fun they have i think this season went incredible and i think next season is going to be even better,0
dustin johnson,1,2022-09,2022,19,0,1,1,for all of you just your thoughts on the week this venue the gallery response from people here in chicago and would you all like to hopefully come back with liv golf here next year,that would have been fine too we wanted to win but a tie would have been kind of fun,0
dustin johnson,1,2022-09,2022,119,0,1,1,MODERATOR,it means a lot obviously with the caliber of players that are playing especially now on liv we've got great fields every week we're going to continue to have great fields it's probably going to even get better starting next year but even right now our fields are unbelievable for me it's something new it's something exciting i'm really enjoying being out here and we're playing at great venues and they do a wonderful job putting on the tournaments i think you talk to any of the fans the players whoever staff they do a great job taking care of everyone and making it a great experience for everyone i'm just really happy to be a part of it,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-10,2023,314,1,0,1,MODERATOR,yeah i think that brooks has played some of the best golf of anybody in the world this year he won the pga he played phenomenal in the majors played phenomenal out here just won last week like it's not there's a lot of other guys i would rather be playing against so i've got my work cut out for me but i have the utmost respect for him and any time i have a chance to play with him or against him i enjoy it he is always professional to play with play against and i expect that we are going to have a fun match but there's also a mutual respect between us that i believe we share and i think it's going to be you know very professional and i'm hoping that i can play some of my best golf because i know i need to to just make it competitive now that we know the team matchups we need to reveal the players that will be competing against each other now this is the first time we are going to be hearing of all of this i don't know who is playing against who either captains don't even know who the other captains have selected to play individual matches or the foursomes so this is going to be fun lots of great storylines as a reminder the captains will play each other in the individual match play so it is now time to reveal the individual matches first up stinger versus iron heads obviously we have louis versus kevin the other singles match will be branden grace versus scott vincent and that leaves us for the foursome with deane burmester charl schwartzel sihwan kim and danny lee louis we'll start with you how do you feel about the matchups what was your decision to not put branden in the foursomes,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-10,2023,87,0,1,1,MODERATOR,yeah i mean i don't have anything to say but compliments about brooks and his play and what he's done this year and what he's done for his own game but also for liv golf i'm excited for the opportunity to play against him but like i said there's a lot of other guys i'd rather play against he just won last week and he's played some exceptional golf and i'm going to have to bring out some of my best golf just to make me competitive,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-10,2023,195,1,0,1,did you seriously not know you would win an extra million on sunday and have you got some crap or that since,i guess i don't i'm just bringing like facts to life as to like why that's happening but really we as a group as a league that's trying to grow the game and bring it globally and promote the game throughout the world as well as bring something different than the old stodgy format that we've had for decades we just need to focus on what we are doing and make our product as good as possible as interesting as possible we need to make tweaks into our program the owgr need to obviously make tweaks but we need to tweak our format to continue to evolve and be more interesting and easier to understand we have enough on our plate to make our product more and more exciting and appealing that we shouldn't worry ourselves with what they are doing but i do want to bring to light as to why exactly they are doing what they are doing it's not what they are putting out there on the front page there's a lot more going on behind the scenes as to the importance of us to the getting points to the pga tour,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-10,2023,74,1,1,1,what was your reaction when you found out,i think that the majors need to protect their product and there's probably other ways that they can do that by creating slots if they want to make sure they have the best fields in golf they could create vehicles for players on liv to play in majors where they don't have to use the owgr which would undermine the tv contract and revenue of the pga tour if they gave points to liv,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-10,2023,137,1,0,1,is that a shame as a captain don't you think you should,i wasn't intentionally playing slow i know that in the ' pga final round brooks felt the same way but really all i was trying to do was get a visualization of the shot and get in kind of like my own little bubble and world maybe i was playing slow maybe i wasn't it wasn't my intent my intent was to get into a calm state and have good visualization and play my best golf and unfortunately i lost on the last hole to cam but look i'm going to be trying to do the same thing tomorrow i'm not trying to play slow i'm always saying look go ahead go ahead and hit like i'm not trying to throw you out of your rhythm but i don't want to be taken out of mine either,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-10,2023,75,0,1,1,my question is for phil we saw your reaction last week to the owgr ruling and i just wanted to follow on that to you they did open the door or leave open the possibility that liv could resubmit its bid or its application how do you feel about that do you feel that liv should reapply do you think that they should make the changes that they are sort of hinting at to try to comply whenever that might be,no he's not seen me on a course yet yeah he'll be him and jena are going to come down later in the week i don't think he's going to come to the course but it would be nice to finally i guess get done playing or get done practicing whatever it might be and get to go home and go spend time with him new experience for me so i'm looking forward to it,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-10,2023,57,0,1,1,are following up on what you said earlier you said liv needs to continue to evolve how would you like to see liv evolve now that you've seen it for one full season now,yeah listen i watched chase work over the last year and a half spent more time around him it's been fun for me to see him evolve grow as a person grow as a man i'd take him back in a heartbeat you know he's just got to go out and do play good simple as that,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-10,2023,159,1,0,1,you got cam last year and brooks this year two of the best players out here not the easiest draws you've had for match play cam said last year you had a little gamesmanship in your match and said you designed of took forever out there are you planning on using that again this year against brooks to try and slow him about a little bit,i think he's an incredible talent our team is very invested in his success and we want him to succeed we've enjoyed our time together so he's a great addition to the team and we're going to miss him if he's not on the team because of the many intangibles he brings but the reality is i've been fielding calls as we all have from players that are free agents to pga tour players to dp world tour players that want to come over you know the spot's probably going to be filled by the time the qualifying tournament is here so if i'm just being truthful that's a very real possibility and even if it is filled there's always the possibility of a trade to get him back there's ways this could work out but i think there's a good chance based on the number of calls that we've had that the spot will be filled fairly soon,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-10,2023,104,0,1,1,similar to what phil answered what is your stance on the situation with the world golf ranking points and the future with liv in those points,do i think that no i know that's going to happen when players look at liv they are wanting to be a part of it everybody here is happy and enjoying what we are doing and enjoying the team aspect of it and enjoying each other and the camaraderie and enjoying playing golf globally and all the benefits that come with playing this tour so there's a lot of players that see that and want to be a part of it the question is you know how many spots are available there's a lot more players that want to come than there are spots,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-10,2023,34,0,1,1,my question is for cam brooks phil and kevin na all four of you have teammates that are in the relegation spot there's going to be a promotion event that happens in a few weeks where they have one last chance to get in the top three to earn their spot back to liv golf next year if one of your guys is in one of three spots are you taking them back on your team cam phil kevin and brooks what do you think,there's a lot of players that could be signed not even through the qualifying you know there's spots on teams that are open that players want to come over and be a part of,0
cameron smith,1,2023-07,2023,190,0,1,1,it's been quite a year between the open obviously going to liv having all the success you've had how would you assess cam smith the golfer and cam smith the person a year on after everything that's happened as you sit here now,i think the person is the same i think my old boy would give me a clip around the ears if he was any different i think as a golfer i think i'm actually a better golfer now than what i was last year i think the stuff that i had to clean up is progressing it's still a little bit of a work in progress i said this morning to someone that kind of my iron and up has always been a bit of a struggle for me and that's an area of the game that we've worked probably harder than we have on in the past i feel like it's right there it just all has to come together i think the first round i had at centurion a couple of weeks ago was the first time where i felt like it had all come together and then the driver again wasn't my best friend on the weekend there but i managed to kind of scramble out a good week so yeah it's there it just hasn't been there for all four rounds but it feels really close,0
cameron smith,1,2023-07,2023,137,0,1,1,defending a title is very different to winning one you now have a target on your back given the decision that you made to join liv i just wondered how much determination you have to come back here as reigning open champion to show the world of golf just how good a player you are all over again,yeah i think liv aside i'm determined to try my best every week and just try and be a better golfer than i was last week i never really expect too much of myself the thing i expect are doing everything percent ticking all the boxes early in the week making sure i'm prepared and then just go out there and give it my all that's all i can really do i think i've done that fantastic this year and especially last year it was such a good year last year you almost expect to win i think that's not really a good way to look at golf just expect to do all the things that you're meant to do percent and then go out there and give it a crack and if you win you win,0
cameron smith,1,2023-07,2023,41,0,1,1,does being a liv player come into it at all in any way especially given that this is arguably the most traditional and historic event in golf,no i don't think so i think we're all here to win the claret jug and basically any one of these guys if they have their week this week is going to walk away with it yeah we'll see what happens,0
cameron smith,1,2023-07,2023,71,1,1,1,with all the uncertainty surrounding the deal between the pga tour and the public investment fund have you been given any assurances over what the future of liv golf might look like and are you optimistic about what your future might look like,yeah absolutely i'm optimistic i think golf is in a great spot there's obviously a lot of things that are up in the air that no one really knows at the moment i don't even think the guys that are trying to sort it out really know what this outcome is going to be like yeah a lot of uncertainty but i'm optimistic that liv will be around in the future,0
cameron smith,1,2023-07,2023,60,0,1,1,cam i think you said recently that your win was slightly tarnished by being asked so quickly about liv i was wondering is that something that did gnaw at you throughout the year and is it something you can use as an extra motivating factor this time,yeah i think it was frustrating at the time just given the circumstance but then i guess looking back on it it's just a guy just trying to do his job and asked a question that everyone really wanted to know i don't think there's any added motivation there i don't have any hard feelings towards anyone there at all,0
cameron smith,1,2023-07,2023,98,1,1,1,now that you don't see these guys on the pga tour as much are the majors more enjoyable for you to come and get that competition back four times a year that you used to get basically on a weekly basis,yeah i think it's good seeing old friends probably more than the competition stuff we're still trying to play our best golf out on the liv tour and there's still a lot of competition especially at the top end there where they push you to play your best to win a golf tournament yeah it's good to see scottie i don't see him a whole lot anymore we've managed to have a few practice rounds in the majors this year and we're going to have it again this afternoon yeah it's good to see familiar faces especially friends,0
cameron smith,1,2023-07,2023,114,1,1,1,cam if you go back to last year and one of the great closing rounds in major history and the decision to join liv and suspension losing your parking spot at sawgrass big deal lawsuits start of a new year all that stuff does last year seem like a long time ago or a short time ago secondly as much of a guy who doesn't seem to get bothered by much what part of all that do you think caused the most turmoil for you,yeah it does seem like a long time ago last year i think it all went so quick for me really to be honest between the decision to go and then being back in australia and then starting again this year i wasn't a part of all the lawsuit stuff i tried to stay as far away from that as possible like i've said in the past the pga tour is a great place to play golf and it will be for a very long time i don't think there was any part of me that made me think i made the wrong decision throughout any part of the last eight or nine months,0
cameron smith,1,2023-07,2023,8,0,1,1,did you notice any change in perception or attitude when you went from cam smith open champion to cam smith open champion and liv golfer,as far as from a play standpoint or,0
cameron smith,1,2023-07,2023,79,1,1,1,just in terms of how the public treated you or how you felt you were perceived,no i've never tried too much to worry about what people thought of me and i think liv was really well received in australia they were probably the two most important things to me i think when i went down to australia to play the pga and the open at the end of the year there was no public kind of uproar of me switching tours they were just happy to see me there playing golf that was awesome,0
cameron smith,1,2023-05,2023,43,1,0,1,i think they said your ties the low fourth round in a pga at oak hill what's it like to leave here with a little piece of history,yeah that's always nice those stats i mean you never really think of before you are teeing off i think the goal is to go out there and shoot as low as you can yeah that's a kind of nice feeling i guess,0
cameron smith,1,2023-05,2023,89,0,1,1,long way to go but brooks is obviously having another good week in a major and obviously has on liv i don't know how much you've played with him but anything you have seen in him over the last few months that suggests that he would keep being in this position here now,i mean every time i play with brooks he is pretty impressive to be honest i haven't really played too many times where he has kind of scrapped it around he has always been a great ball striker when he is holing putts like he is at the moment he is pretty dangerous like he said as well i think he is back to being healthy i think that brings a little bit of internal confidence as well being out there and just being able to do your stuff,0
cameron smith,1,2023-05,2023,68,0,1,1,i don't know if we're past this point yet or not but there are four liv guys i believe top or so right now does it say anything or should we even be talking about it anymore,i don't think so i gave up on that narrative about six months ago i think laughing i think there's been a few guys that have been trying to kick it along a little bit we're still out there we haven't forgot how to play golf we're all great golfers out there and we know what we can do and i think that's what we're trying to do,0
cameron smith,1,2023-04,2023,62,0,1,1,how different does it feel being here as a liv player playing on a different tour in terms of the preparation and opportunities that it's given you but in terms of the current state of golf at the moment and the kind of conversations that have been going on all year,there definitely hasn't been a conversation with me if there was one i definitely got left out of that one laughter i'm not sure what's going to happen mate i guess we'll see how the week unfolds for sure i'd love to see one of us guys get up to the top of the leaderboard and really give it a nice shot,0
cameron smith,1,2023-04,2023,146,0,1,1,and just to follow up can you shed any light on the conversations that have been had amongst the liv players that are going to be here in terms of potentially a joint celebration sunday night behind the th green,i think for me it's about letting the golf course almost open itself up to you it's never really a golf course where you can go out and try and make birdies i think that's maybe been a part of my game especially this year where i feel like i played so good last year had such a good year the expectation was really quite high then you go out there and you try to make stuff happen rather than just letting it come to you i feel like you have to be really patient around here i for sure think there's some second shots to some given pins out on those greens where you have to be quite cautious and i think the golf course offers especially under a bit of a softer ground i think it offers a lot of birdie chances as well,0
cameron smith,1,2023-04,2023,59,0,1,1,as you've gained experience around here can you explain how when you assess to take chances on this golf course and how much that balance as changed from the beginning to your most recent start here,i think for me i'm just trying to play the best golf i can for me it's frustration when i'm playing like this on any tour as the liv tour grows and the fields get deeper and stronger and all that stuff unfolds it's just going to be better and better i can't wait to see it unfold personally,0
cameron smith,1,2023-04,2023,53,0,1,1,when you look back to last july obviously winning the open was a pinnacle accomplishment and highest profile point in your career and i know you've been very obviously dialed in and immersed in liv but at this point now as you step away do you feel at all because you're not seen as much and liv is not as obviously as big as the tour is there any concern about not being as relevant in the world stage and if you even care about that,yeah for sure there's been a couple of tournaments that i really have enjoyed in the past that i feel like i've missed out on but at the same time i've made my bed and i'm happy very very happy where i am i'm happy to sleep in the bed i'm in basically,0
cameron smith,1,2023-04,2023,142,0,1,1,you talked about the hugs and handshakes and whatnot when you walked on to the range what were you expecting,i think it's just important for liv guys to be up there because i think we need to be up there i think there's a lot of chatter about these guys don't play real golf these guys don't play real golf courses for sure i'll be the first one to say the fields aren't as strong i'm the first one to say that but we've still got a lot of guys up there that can play some really serious golf and we compete against each other hard week in and week out and we're trying to do the same things that we did six months ago it's nice it's a good feeling to have that competition and it's good to see brooks win last week he's playing some really good golf again yeah i think we just need a good strong finish,0
cameron smith,1,2023-04,2023,123,0,1,1,secondly when you talked about hoping to see some liv players up there on the leaderboard just like i'm sure you'd like to see whoever your mates are previously up there why do you think that's or do you think it's important that there are liv golfers up there high on the leaderboard sunday and if so why,yeah this is probably one of the tournaments for me where i get the most nervous i guess i think that first tee just the crowd the atmosphere you get around here is unlike anywhere else just gives me goosebumps thinking about it come thursday and then sunday is almost a different monster when you are stepping up with a lead or in contention you really have to learn how to control all those emotions to be honest for me once i hit that first tee shot i generally calm down a little bit and can really start to see the round unfold but you know that half an hour before is yeah it's not nice but it's something you look forward to,0
cameron smith,1,2023-04,2023,81,1,1,1,obviously you wear the maroon on sundays because you take a lot of inspiration from origin can you caught many rugby games this season the broncos,i just think there's too much rubbish going on basically for me like i said out there i spent an hour out there and seen lots of familiar faces lots of smiles and hugs and it's been nice i don't think there's any kind of hatred going on between the players we are all happy where we are and i'm just as happy for the guys winning out on the pga tour as i am for the liv golfers as well,0
cameron smith,1,2023-04,2023,57,0,1,1,just to expand on one of your earlier answers you said you think a little bit too much is being made around the sort of liv narrative could you just build on that and sort of tell me specifically what it is you think,yeah basically you know for me personally i have another set of clothes made up this week without them we haven't really heard much from augusta national about the logos and for me personally i'm really proud of where i'm at and what i'm doing unless it's a problem for these guys i'm going to wear it,0
cameron smith,1,2023-04,2023,1,0,1,1,just one on the logos obviously it gets attention when the liv guys wear the logos is that a contractual obligation to wear them,yeah,0
cameron smith,1,2022-10,2022,86,0,1,1,obviously you kind of have a full season now how much are you looking forward to,yeah it'll be good i think i'm really looking forward to getting home playing the events down there i haven't won an australian open so i'll be trying to do that the round out there today kind of gave me that momentum that i needed heading down there yeah i can't wait for next year i think it's going to be really exciting i think liv golf is going to be bigger and better because of this event and i can't wait for it to start,0
brooks koepka,1,2022-10,2022,4,0,1,1,for all four captains just going from two days of match play to now stroke play all four rounds count that's the first time that's happened in a liv round what's the mentality in making switch from match play to stroke play dj maybe start first,add a couple zeros,0
dustin johnson,1,2022-10,2022,77,0,1,1,brooks you guys are on a roll right now just the mentality of switching back to stroke play you have four strong guys playing well now,but yeah for us it's all about the competition we want to win the first championship of liv golf and yeah i mean it's all about tomorrow it's anybody's ballgame i don't think there's every team up here obviously is playing well there's no favorites in my eyes tomorrow you know it's what four guys can play the best on the teams obviously because all four scores count so everybody on your team has to play well,0
dustin johnson,1,2022-10,2022,54,0,1,1,not really sure who to send this question to but if any of you want to speak up go for it do any of you feel a sense of rivalry with any other team in this league or any other golfer in this league and if not how do you see rivalry being created manifesting in the league,it would be great obviously it's the first liv team championship it's kind of the first year of this and i think it's gone really well and it just kind of sets up for things to come yeah i think it would be amazing and it's something that we all really want to win,0
cameron smith,1,2022-10,2022,72,0,1,1,how much,it wouldn't really bother me to be honest i think like all other events i don't know if it's the same for these guys but i spend more time looking at the team leaderboard than i do the actual individual leaderboard so i don't know it's quite unique but that's what i love about liv golf it's just so different and you're worried about your mates sometimes more than you are yourself,0
brooks koepka,1,2022-10,2022,31,0,1,1,i was wondering if every team in the liv tour was to play in a beer pong tournament who would win,yeah i mean i think we've all played so much golf together it doesn't really matter all three of them are pretty damn good players i'll take any one of them,0
phil mickelson,1,2022-10,2022,55,1,0,1,MODERATOR,let me just clarify that he doesn't have to pick from the last four he can pick from all seven teams so if you want a rematch of like the ' pga you could pick our team and we could play each other i'm just clarifying the rules because i don't know if everybody understands,0
phil mickelson,1,2022-10,2022,282,0,1,1,MODERATOR,from a team perspective this was a pretty easy decision for us because bernd and cameron play a very similar game they play a very similar golf ball and they look at the golf course the same way so this is going to keep them in their same element same strategy their caddies get along really well and are very close and i think that it's going to kind of lead to a cohesiveness and like a game plan our alternate shot foursome team was pretty easy to set especially when you look at matt wolff and how being one of the longest players on liv if not well bryson is out here but right behind bryson he's hitting the ball in places that we just don't see he's got so much firepower that when he gets in a groove and he gets it going we've seen throughout the liv events that he shoots some scores on some very challenging courses and this is one of them his length allows him to see this golf course totally different in a much more aggressive frame of mind i love his game for match play because he's going to be able to take advantage of a lot of the holes and make birdies get at some of these pins despite the water despite the challenges because he'll be coming at it with a much shorter club i really like him in singles and i really like bernd and cameron together and the cohesiveness that they provide then cameron smith and i will all naturally be irrelevant is the game plan like that's our plan but we are still going to play we'll still play,0
phil mickelson,1,2022-10,2022,151,0,1,1,phil you seem cautious to maybe not sledge or intimidate cam too much is there a reason behind that do you not want to wake the snake,well first of all what a great win he had last week he played some great golf i think it was an impressive victory but just maybe i shouldn't have said stuff like that i don't know but if i'm just looking at liv golf and where we are today to where we were six seven months ago and people are saying this is dead in the water and we're past that and here we are today a force in the game that's not going away that has players of this caliber that are moving professional golf throughout the world and the excitement level in the countries around the world of having some of the best players in the game of golf coming to their country and competing it's pretty remarkable how far liv golf has come in the last six seven months i don't think anybody can disagree with that,0
phil mickelson,1,2022-10,2022,111,1,1,1,phil a couple of weeks ago you said you saw liv trending upwards and pga tour trending downwards i'm not sure if you saw but rory mcilroy came out and said that that's just propaganda on your behalf can you speak to that,first of all those numbers can be very confusing for them what the range finders does is it really helps me because i don't have yardages on sprinklers from other fairways so when i get over there i have a much more committed swing because i know exactly how far it is otherwise we're trying to angle it it's just a lot of work to get yardages to one hole from two fairways let alone three and lasers just give me that freedom it's no coincidence that the first time lasers were ever allowed on the pga tour was the pga championship in look how that ended up it's no coincidence,0
brooks koepka,1,2022-10,2022,116,1,1,1,just a question for phil it's another one on the rory mcilroy interview in the guardian today he's spoken more generally about it and said this us versus them thing has gotten way out of control already and he's encouraging some level of kind of reconciliation i suppose i'm wondering from your perspective what that needs to look like and how this whole situation moves forward,yeah it's super nice to be able to drive an hour and minutes down the road and be able to get here i mean i don't know how many guys i'd say in this field there's probably that live in jupiter so it's convenient and i think a lot of us have just played it if you've grown up in florida playing junior golf tournaments or just playing it for fun and then obviously the pga tour was here for years played it quite a bit and feel comfortable but like you said it's nice to have family friends be able to come to an event when they don't get to see us play too much,0
cameron smith,1,2022-09,2022,78,0,1,1,cam obviously you guys now go to thailand and saudi arabia how important is it to have a global calendar in liv golf,yeah i think it's fantastic that's one of the reasons why i came over here is to play golf around the world i think my time when i was a young professional over in asia are some of the best times of my life traveling with good friends and playing really good tournaments was something i'll never forget and i'm really looking forward and really excited to what this tour is going to bring to the golf world,0
cameron smith,1,2022-09,2022,55,0,1,1,the crowd seemed fairly large out there today could you sense that how much did you feed off that,yeah i think liv has done a great job with engaging the crowd i think there's a great layout here in and around like they seem to get loud we had a really good following today all day it's a big walk out there and the fans did it all day so it was perfect,0
cameron smith,1,2022-09,2022,69,1,1,1,i know you're not from the u s but you've played here long enough but places like chicago boston they aren't cities that have regular tour stops do you feel like that's a positive for liv to be able to serve some of these fans that don't get a chance to see pga tour golf or elite pro golf,yeah absolutely i think it's great to bring golf to where it hasn't been for a very long time i know we were up in chicago maybe a few years ago but it seems to be one that goes on and off the schedule i think the fans really appreciate it and hopefully we can come to these communities and keep giving back and showing them what they want,0
cameron smith,1,2022-09,2022,80,0,1,1,my question is about what's going on in fan village with the mullet action i walked by and asked them and they're almost up to haircuts that guys have gone out and got mullets liv is going to donate for each of those haircuts my question is what amount of money would we need to pull together to donate on the punch gc's team for you to not only all get mullets but go all clean shaven you've got the mustache going jonesy has got a little stubble going marc has got a full beard and wade has got a 'stache too,i think punch gc has got a very unique style throughout the group i think we're all a little bit different i think we all have our little quirkiness about us to shave it all off mate i don't think there's a number it would take it would take a lot i know for me to get rid of this i feel like this is my good luck charm so i'm going to hang with it for a little bit,0
phil mickelson,1,2022-09,2022,92,0,1,1,MODERATOR,i mean the energy is different we all have a say everybody is being listened to we had a great players' meeting and they're listening to what everybody is saying and trying to make the best product if there's something we can improve on we make a change i love the feel of wearing shorts i think that kind of i know but it's consistent with what liv golf is all about it's making it it's updating the professional golf i think we're all enjoying the fan friendly and player friendly environment,0
phil mickelson,1,2022-09,2022,164,1,1,1,MODERATOR,the pga tour for the last or years have had all the best players in the world that will never be the case again liv golf is here to stay and this type of divisive talk is doing nobody good the best solution is for us to come together i think that the world of professional golf has a need for the old historical history of the game product that the pga tour provides and i think that liv provides a really cool updated feel that is attracting a lot younger crowd and that's being proven in the people that are watching and the age of the people that are watching i think both are needed for the game of golf both are good for the game of golf the inclusion of liv golf in the ecosystem of the golf world is necessary as soon as that happens and we all start working together that's going to be a really positive thing for everyone,0
cameron smith,1,2022-09,2022,5,1,0,1,i talked to kevin streelman a couple days ago he doesn't like what's going on and a lot of pga tour members don't like what's going on because they think that it's lessening the global competition across golf not all the best players are here and not all the best players are there and he's also upset about the lawsuit obviously because he feels like it's an affront to the pga tour members themselves can you just address those two things,i'm not answering that laughter,0
cameron smith,1,2022-09,2022,73,1,1,1,we feel really hurt that the pga has skipped us but we're so excited that liv is here and we hope you're coming back to rich harvest farms cam have you ever seen the movie joe dirt,i mean this is my second one i thought last week was great in boston i think there was probably a few more holes given the routing this week where there's a few more people standing around so i definitely felt that today i think that section around was fantastic i think there's a ton of people out here and i can't wait for the weekend i think it's going to be fantastic,0
cameron smith,1,2022-09,2022,72,0,1,1,going back to today at the first tee were you aware that liv golf ceo greg norman was going to drop in by parachute,i had heard some whispers but that stuff frightens me if i was him i'd get up there and tell them to go back down i was expecting it but i was unsure if he was going to get down or not yeah it was cool that was something that i haven't experienced before on the first hole it's just a good way to start a tournament i think that was unreal,0
cameron smith,1,2022-08,2022,98,1,0,1,just a teams question if i can how much different is professional golf going to be week in week out for you guys now that you are not just playing for yourself can you go through what you enjoy and hope to improve about the teams aspect,yeah i'm still i haven't resigned my membership as on the pga tour i think yeah my life has definitely changed over the last you know couple of months after the british open i've had a few phone calls with players i sat down with jay we had a good conversation it has been a little bit different but this for me was the right decision you know i think this is the future of golf i think it's been the same for a very very long time and it needs to be stirred up a little bit,1
cameron smith,1,2022-08,2022,92,0,1,1,there has been criticism and backlash how does that sit with you cam how do you take that criticism how does it play into your preparation for your debut liv event,yeah i think we should see a pretty good showing out here i think it will be good out here i think with the music with the fans it will be embraced particularly with the younger fans i think speaking to the kid that drove me back from the driving range before he loved the fact that there was music on the course music on the range he loved to see how relaxed the players were how not so uptight i guess it was yeah i think it's going to be great,1
cameron smith,1,2022-08,2022,124,0,1,1,first off gentlemen welcome to the liv tour now this question is for cam a lot has been made of your hair but i'm going to talk about your facial hair for a moment when liv does get official world ranking points and you do hit world no do you think your body will finally allow you to grow a full beard,i think during our season now if it works in the schedule for sure it's something that i would think about i think back to the days of the asian tour i had such a great time i was only probably years old traveling around asia most of the world playing the sport that we love there was so many good times so many good people and it's something that i've missed i think travelling and playing golf as you know on tour we don't get to spend much time outside of the united states for me that's another exciting thing playing the best courses around the world and bringing golf to new places is something that i think i'm really going to love,1
cameron smith,1,2022-08,2022,66,1,0,1,i also have a grass obsession laughter different type of grass they don't grow it out here,you took the words out of my mouth really i'm about the same i really don't know enough about what the pga tour is doing to you know comment on that but i'm really comfortable with this decision to be out here i think this is the new thing i'm excited about it and it's going to be awesome i can't wait for this to grow,1
cameron smith,1,2022-08,2022,75,1,0,1,when you started you played a few events on the asian tour in the start of your career before you moved on one of the things that you can still do if you can't play on the pga tour and the other tour is play on the asian tour during the year is that something that you want to consider and secondly can you talk a bit about those days the year or so that you were on the asian tour did you enjoy it,not particularly mate to be honest for me the biggest attraction was spending more time at home getting that part of my life back it's something that i've really missed i think obviously the pandemic that we've had over the last couple years didn't really help out but you know for me to be able to go home see my family and play golf there more often that was a really big up for me,1
cameron smith,1,2022-08,2022,66,0,1,1,since we always brought up the liv thing and you were unwilling to discuss it before and you're now here can you tell us when you first started talking to liv,for me i flew up yesterday morning i think the announcement was made in the morning it was a pretty crazy day to be honest i come out here hit some balls myself i don't spend a lot of time on social media if any and you know had a nice dinner with dad and a friend and went to sleep it was much the same,1
cameron smith,1,2022-08,2022,18,0,1,1,you've won the open and you're now here at liv can you speak to the differences in your approach if any to the pre round hair care routine,saltwater is my favorite product i love getting out in the saltwater and letting it kind of flourish,1
cameron smith,1,2022-07,2022,19,0,1,1,cam apologies for having to bring this up in these circumstances but your name continues to be mentioned has been mentioned to me this week about liv golf what's your position are you interested is there any truth to suggestions that you might be signing,i don't know mate my team around me worries about all that stuff i'm here to win golf tournaments,0
cameron smith,1,2022-07,2022,8,0,1,1,there's been a lot of talk and controversy over the past few months regarding the liv golf series do you think being back at the home of golf this prestigious competition th anniversary that it will put the focus back onto the game and bring players together,he's about four times the size of me,0
cameron smith,1,2022-06,2022,71,1,0,1,cam just the driver changes specifically what are they is the shaft shorter is it a different shaft,i would love if the pga tour would go down there and play some golf it's something that i haven't been able to do personally for a couple of years due to covid but i miss playing at home i'm sure all the fans at home miss seeing world quality golf i know the presidents cup down there was well received hopefully we can get some more good players down there,0
cameron smith,1,2022-06,2022,46,1,0,1,what would be your ideal vision for the pga tour adding regular stops in australia,i haven't too much mate to be honest this week my focus is to play golf i'm far from the smartest person in the room and i'm not a politician i'm here to follow a white golf ball around and kind of see what it does,0
cameron smith,1,2022-06,2022,2,0,1,1,back with the almost compulsory liv golf question how have you viewed that from a distance,what's that,0
cameron smith,1,2022-06,2022,47,1,0,1,and the last one for me do you expect yourself to be at the top of the leaderboard week in week out now record setting fashion sentry you won the whale at the players you were there for a long long time at the pga championship you were there for a long time at the masters do you expect to be up there,i think so i think my game's in a good spot there's no reason why i shouldn't be i'm playing some of the best golf of my life and i feel i'm getting more consistent with the longer stuff so just looking forward to everything coming up,0
cameron smith,1,2022-06,2022,72,1,0,1,even though you haven't had success in this tournament i know i guess it was seven years ago in the qualifying after you missed the cut the first time here how big a turning point was that to i guess you birdied four of the last holes to get into the u s open,yeah that was such a long time ago that was a good experience i think that changed my career getting into the u s open ended up having a really good finish there and it set up a lot of stuff on the pga tour it's been a bit of a roller coaster especially that first couple of years of my pro career but happy it turned out the way it did,0
cameron smith,1,2022-05,2022,86,1,0,1,you reset yourself for every major and every tournament do you carry any frustrating you've been doing pretty well at the majors but didn't get to the finish line any frustrating anything that you regret or not really,yeah i think the pga is probably the one that i've struggled with the most it's typically set up very demanding off the tee i don't think that's really been my strong suit out here ever a lot of work the last week on the driver trying to get it straight rather than trying to get a little bit more distance out of it yeah just more opportunities from the fairway i think is what i need especially around here the rough can be pretty penal,0
cameron smith,1,2022-05,2022,51,1,0,1,you've had a great result in the majors but at the start of the new season do you look at the majors in terms of your fondness for the setup of the courses i know you had a great result at augusta but where would the sort of pga championship rate start of the new season and you look towards to the four majors,yeah i think the course has got a good mix with long and short holes i think it's going to be quite windy so there might be a few other woods or longer irons off the tee it's a bit of a thinker's golf course around here i really like it,0
cameron smith,1,2022-04,2022,69,0,1,1,last time we talked i asked you about what the celebration was going to be like after the players you said you were looking forward to going to sleep i hear it was otherwise can you tell us about that night,no we just went back home live about ten minutes away so easy drive back home started the fire up and just had a few beers and that was pretty much it we got back actually pretty late we had dinner at the club and probably got back about and yeah it didn't take didn't take that long for me to get to sleep last night that's for sure,0
cameron smith,1,2022-04,2022,52,1,0,1,before you won the players what would you say was your most memorable moment in golf at any level,i think my first aussie pga it was down the gold coast probably only minutes away from where i grew up so i had lots of family and friends there it was such a cool moment i thought that would be pretty tough to beat but i think the players got it,0
cameron smith,1,2022-03,2022,45,0,1,1,MODERATOR,it's cool being here in jacksonville i live here now i call this place home and had a lot of fans out there rooting for me today it was so good of the fans to come out today on monday and give it their all,0
cameron smith,1,2022-03,2022,58,0,1,1,how often do you see your family even in the best of times given the distance and who exactly made it here,yeah mum's name is sharon and my sister's name is melanie yeah it's so cool obviously lots of australians have won here lots of great australian golfers have won here you know but the best that have ever lived have won here as well so it's pretty cool to have the name on the same trophy as them,0
cameron smith,1,2022-03,2022,51,0,1,1,you told us yesterday that despite living five miles from here you try not to play this course how if at all did that help you or maybe now are you saying maybe i want to play this course a couple more times a year,yeah i don't know i think both sides of my family my mum and my dad's side both have just both mentally strong they're working class people who have had to work their whole life to live basically and yeah i guess that's just kind of what i grew up in,0
cameron smith,1,2022-02,2022,58,1,0,1,obviously you started the year in record breaking fashion with that lowest ever hole score on the pga tour is there a feeling that this might be a big year for you is that something you buy into,to be honest i'm just trying to do the best i can every day i know that sounds kind of cliche one shot at a time i've done a good job of preparing myself i think before tournaments at home i've been working a bit harder in the gym and yeah hopefully all the hard work pays off,0
cameron smith,1,2022-02,2022,44,1,0,1,it was reported in the daily telegraph in london this morning that ian poulter has been offered £ million to jump to the super league is that something that would interest you or are you a pga tour guy,again that's a conversation for another time i've got guys around me and a really good team around me that can think about that stuff they're just worried about how i can compete and how i can be the best golfer i can be,0
cameron smith,1,2022-01,2022,93,1,0,1,what's more impressive to you the fact that you were able to hold fire and keep pace and obviously win this or you were able to do it with playing with jon rahm the world no over the weekend,yeah i mean this is as close as we get basically on the pga tour to home so it's nice to have a couple of wins here i'm really looking forward to next week obviously i've got a really good history there i've won there before i love the golf course it reminds me so much of where i grew up playing golf i feel really comfortable around there and i can't wait for thursday i know that's i feel like i'm drained at the moment but i'm excited for next week already,0
cameron smith,1,2022-01,2022,52,1,0,1,what about this victory feels different from the other three on the pga tour,i guess all the guys are here that have won the year prior they have all had a really good season and they all know how to win so to be able to win against the winners i guess is really cool i'll definitely draw a lot of confidence off that yeah,0
cameron smith,1,2022-01,2022,43,1,0,1,does this win help to lessen the feeling of missing out of playing one of your favorite events in the australian pga at home,yeah it's obviously something that i hate missing out on i would love to be there to compete but i'm sure the australian fans will draw a lot from this week and hopefully i've given them something to cheer for over the weekend,0
cameron smith,1,2022-01,2022,62,1,0,1,does breaking the record for lowest score make in pga tour history feel extra special and were you aware of the record coming into today's round,yeah one of the media guys reminded me after our first couple of rounds which was really nice of him to do smiling but yeah i was aware of it i didn't really think about it over the weekend i was more worried about just trying to win the golf tournament and i guess that kind of pushed me over the edge,0
cameron smith,1,2022-01,2022,57,1,0,1,ernie els was under after when he went under for a pga tour record in do you think about numbers like that and when you think about being at the same point as he was on the way to what's your reaction to that,yeah i mean if you hadn't have told me that i would have had no idea i'm really i'm just trying to do the best i can to be honest i'm worried about one shot at a time those records are cool and stuff but yeah i'm just trying to do my best i can every shot,0
cameron smith,1,2021-08,2021,34,1,0,1,i know it has to sting but you're third in the fedexcup standings and there's still the fedexcup championship out there the pga tour's ultimate prize still within your grasp,yeah that's why we're here we're here for the fedexcup luckily for us there's always next week and we've got two events left to try to make another move so looking forward to it,0
cameron smith,1,2021-06,2021,31,1,0,1,it was pretty tough going for the aussies at the pga are you optimistic about a bounce back,yeah absolutely i think there's probably four or five of us that are playing really good golf at the moment let's hope for australia that we can finally get one home,0
cameron smith,1,2021-04,2021,43,1,0,1,cam what do you remember most from it was your first pga tour victory in what's your favorite memory and what really worked for you that week,i mean it's new orleans you just i mean we just enjoyed ourselves we stayed in the same hotel went out for dinner every night tried a lot of different food maybe a couple beers here and there and no it was good,0
cameron smith,1,2021-04,2021,35,1,0,1,your low round on the pga tour what helped you get it done out there today,i don't know everything just came together it was a great day on the green i was hitting my irons really good i had lots of good looks and i just took advantage of them,0
cameron smith,1,2021-03,2021,1,0,1,1,i know you live close by would you consider this your home course,yeah,0
cameron smith,1,2021-03,2021,43,0,1,1,australians have an incredible history with this tournament what's your theory as to why they play so well,i just love this place i live locally i'm out here all the time i mean the fans are great here the locals are awesome people that just i don't know it's like a second home for me but i love it personally,0
cameron smith,1,2021-01,2021,99,1,0,1,masters amounted they will have limited fans curious your thoughts about that and if you view that as encouraging for the future,yeah i mean it seems like the guys that are coming out of college and amateur golf this year are doing so well so early i'm sure we've had a few guys that have contested within the last couple years and i don't know it's hard to say whether they win or not maybe the different pressure of a pga tour event might just hold them back a little bit and they need those few starts to kind of settle in i wouldn't say it's off the cards but i would say it's a very difficult task for sure,0
cameron smith,1,2021-01,2021,20,1,0,1,different question you know a lot of guys it seems are winning early on the pga tour we're seeing it sort of more and more curious if you think an amateur could win out here obviously they don't get as many opportunities but if they would be capable and why or why not,yeah it would surprise me i think you just need the experience of being in contention and having that pressure,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-10,2023,166,0,1,1,MODERATOR,i mean the aces are the strongest team on liv they won it last year they've led throughout the year this year but i'm really proud of my team for today and the effort that our guys made down the stretch to win and to finish the matches off i've got a little work to do a lot of work to do on my game overnight but i've got a team that has really made this fun and special and came through today i'm so proud of steeley and camo and riot and these guys that really played some great golf today we're looking forward to playing the best team in the league well consistently the best team in the league and we're looking forward to the opportunity we know it'll be a challenge but we had a lot of fun today we got a lot out of it we're going to try to recover recuperate build on it and put up a good fight tomorrow,0
dustin johnson,1,2023-10,2023,8,0,1,1,you mentioned that you had a different role with liv last year but now a year in the captaincy role how have you seen the league change over the year and what would you like to see evolve for the next year and going forward,i'm pretty old i know myself pretty well,0
dustin johnson,1,2023-10,2023,37,0,1,1,i just wanted to follow up on the world ranking thing you and talor are the guys that this impacts the most not having won majors and being young up and coming players how much did you consider that when you made the decision to come to liv did you think that your ranking wouldn't drop as fast as it has did you weigh all those issues,i really wasn't involved in it so i don't know to answer your question no i love my team and happy with it i mean even though they got a ringer they still struggled to keep up,0
dustin johnson,1,2023-10,2023,1,0,1,1,so we're two seasons in and i'm curious from a leadership perspective what do you think are the one or two things that you guys have learned about yourselves as leaders of liv leaders of your teams what have you learned about yourself the last couple years,no,0
phil mickelson,1,2022-10,2022,55,1,0,1,MODERATOR,let me just clarify that he doesn't have to pick from the last four he can pick from all seven teams so if you want a rematch of like the ' pga you could pick our team and we could play each other i'm just clarifying the rules because i don't know if everybody understands,0
phil mickelson,1,2022-10,2022,282,0,1,1,MODERATOR,from a team perspective this was a pretty easy decision for us because bernd and cameron play a very similar game they play a very similar golf ball and they look at the golf course the same way so this is going to keep them in their same element same strategy their caddies get along really well and are very close and i think that it's going to kind of lead to a cohesiveness and like a game plan our alternate shot foursome team was pretty easy to set especially when you look at matt wolff and how being one of the longest players on liv if not well bryson is out here but right behind bryson he's hitting the ball in places that we just don't see he's got so much firepower that when he gets in a groove and he gets it going we've seen throughout the liv events that he shoots some scores on some very challenging courses and this is one of them his length allows him to see this golf course totally different in a much more aggressive frame of mind i love his game for match play because he's going to be able to take advantage of a lot of the holes and make birdies get at some of these pins despite the water despite the challenges because he'll be coming at it with a much shorter club i really like him in singles and i really like bernd and cameron together and the cohesiveness that they provide then cameron smith and i will all naturally be irrelevant is the game plan like that's our plan but we are still going to play we'll still play,0
phil mickelson,1,2022-10,2022,151,0,1,1,phil you seem cautious to maybe not sledge or intimidate cam too much is there a reason behind that do you not want to wake the snake,well first of all what a great win he had last week he played some great golf i think it was an impressive victory but just maybe i shouldn't have said stuff like that i don't know but if i'm just looking at liv golf and where we are today to where we were six seven months ago and people are saying this is dead in the water and we're past that and here we are today a force in the game that's not going away that has players of this caliber that are moving professional golf throughout the world and the excitement level in the countries around the world of having some of the best players in the game of golf coming to their country and competing it's pretty remarkable how far liv golf has come in the last six seven months i don't think anybody can disagree with that,0
phil mickelson,1,2022-10,2022,111,1,1,1,phil a couple of weeks ago you said you saw liv trending upwards and pga tour trending downwards i'm not sure if you saw but rory mcilroy came out and said that that's just propaganda on your behalf can you speak to that,first of all those numbers can be very confusing for them what the range finders does is it really helps me because i don't have yardages on sprinklers from other fairways so when i get over there i have a much more committed swing because i know exactly how far it is otherwise we're trying to angle it it's just a lot of work to get yardages to one hole from two fairways let alone three and lasers just give me that freedom it's no coincidence that the first time lasers were ever allowed on the pga tour was the pga championship in look how that ended up it's no coincidence,0
brooks koepka,1,2022-10,2022,116,1,1,1,just a question for phil it's another one on the rory mcilroy interview in the guardian today he's spoken more generally about it and said this us versus them thing has gotten way out of control already and he's encouraging some level of kind of reconciliation i suppose i'm wondering from your perspective what that needs to look like and how this whole situation moves forward,yeah it's super nice to be able to drive an hour and minutes down the road and be able to get here i mean i don't know how many guys i'd say in this field there's probably that live in jupiter so it's convenient and i think a lot of us have just played it if you've grown up in florida playing junior golf tournaments or just playing it for fun and then obviously the pga tour was here for years played it quite a bit and feel comfortable but like you said it's nice to have family friends be able to come to an event when they don't get to see us play too much,0
jon rahm,1,2024-02,2024,69,0,1,1,jon obviously this is just your second liv event but you guys are going to be in a marquee group tomorrow is this kind of what you thought it would be you guys are the best in the world in the final group in the final round,yeah it really doesn't make a difference i remember people telling me oh you have to start out hot the average score of the winner is under i'm like well three days shoot as low as you can that's about it last week i forgot we played three days until somebody mentioned it afterwards and if you hadn't said anything right now i completely would have forgotten as well,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-10,2023,166,0,1,1,MODERATOR,i mean the aces are the strongest team on liv they won it last year they've led throughout the year this year but i'm really proud of my team for today and the effort that our guys made down the stretch to win and to finish the matches off i've got a little work to do a lot of work to do on my game overnight but i've got a team that has really made this fun and special and came through today i'm so proud of steeley and camo and riot and these guys that really played some great golf today we're looking forward to playing the best team in the league well consistently the best team in the league and we're looking forward to the opportunity we know it'll be a challenge but we had a lot of fun today we got a lot out of it we're going to try to recover recuperate build on it and put up a good fight tomorrow,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-04,2023,61,0,1,1,MODERATOR,but would love to do that we went to one of the afl games on sunday night i know me and dustin did so that was quite fun just getting to see it live anytime you watch guys do what they're amazing at and it's a cool sport it's fun it's a real sport those guys beat each other like crazy,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-04,2023,98,1,0,1,MODERATOR,i don't know if there's any other i don't know i haven't spoken to anybody that's on that level to be like hey are you coming over to play it's not my style it's not usually how i approach anybody look i'm sure there's a bunch of guys who are still looking to come over whether that be college players younger players to guys that play on the pga tour or dp tour i'm sure there are people looking to join but yeah you can always add depth to anything the stronger we get the better we are,0
dustin johnson,1,2023-04,2023,54,0,1,1,MODERATOR,yeah i think same obviously the better players we have playing obviously the stronger liv gets and it's better for the game as far as i haven't talked to greg this week so i don't know i can't really comment too much on what he was saying i didn't see what he said either,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-04,2023,83,0,1,1,MODERATOR,keegan matt fitzpatrick patrick cantlay lives on the same street fowler does as well i could run into tour guys if i wanted to in a day and nobody has really had any negative feedback any negative thing to say and that would be the time to say it but i think it was good just for the fans to see that we still communicate we still play together we still practice together do everything the exact same we're still the same people,0
dustin johnson,1,2023-04,2023,137,0,1,1,MODERATOR,yeah i'm the same obviously where we live i think half the golf world lives in south florida i see all the guys all the time it was nice to see at augusta see a few of the guys that you don't see in jupiter or out here on liv a couple buddies i got to see and hang out with but yeah the fans were great heard a lot of go aces and i think they were really good at augusta obviously that is one place where fans are always very respectful they don't really have a choice either but yeah it is the masters and i think everyone just respects augusta and the masters it's more about the golf than what tour you play on i think that's how it should be all the time,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-04,2023,127,0,1,1,MODERATOR,yeah i definitely have just from being at the game on sunday night to just being around for the last two days you see a lot of people just passing by you either in the hotel or things like that and at the game i think it's fantastic i think everyone is just super appreciative that we made the trip down here and we're playing because like you said it's been a long time since anybody has really been able to see the quality of field that i think we're bringing this week it's exciting it's going to be a big thing for cam's team the rippers it's going to be a big thing for liv and a big thing for australia and i think that's amazing,0
dustin johnson,1,2023-04,2023,88,0,1,1,greg earlier this week suggested that there's a long list of players queueing up to join the tour i just wondered if you guys had got any feedback about player feeling at the masters and as greg suggested do you concede that this tour still needs further depth to make it more viable,extracurricular it's a clothing company they're making all the clothes for the aces i think they also do all the merchandise for liv but it's just a new company and yeah we partnered with them and yeah they make great stuff i'm excited we just got a new shipment of shirts for this week but it's kind of just getting started so it's all kind of new it's going to continue to get better the stuff we're making right now is great and i really like wearing it,0
dustin johnson,1,2023-04,2023,1,1,1,1,just a question to all of you from the masters experience it seems that you guys were generally welcomed there within the cohort and also the fans do you all sense i guess a bit of a thawing not so much between the pga and liv but from a fans' perspective and your cohorts do you think the relationships are thawing now particularly sold out crowds here aussies are a pretty pragmatic bunch your thoughts on that,yeah,0
dustin johnson,1,2023-04,2023,171,0,1,1,following on from that a little bit you guys are now in the second season you've got a feel for liv how it's been received how big do you think this tour can get what would be your optimum number of players how many tournaments each year would you like to see where can it go,yeah i mean like i was saying earlier definitely driving because you've got to be able to you've got to hit it out of the fairway here because you've got to control the golf ball coming into the greens because they are fast they are undulated i think if you obviously got a bunch of rain on saturday but the fairways are still firm and fast greens are they're a little soft i think but they're fast if they can get those a little bit firmer i think that's the defense of the course with all the run offs around the greens like i said if you're coming from the fairway obviously you can control the ball a lot better i think that's kind of the defense is the narrow fairways the rough and obviously having firm fast undulating greens is going to that's where it but if you're driving it well the course plays pretty short you can definitely shoot some good scores but if not you're going to struggle,0
dustin johnson,1,2023-04,2023,98,0,1,1,i was just wondering i heard phil talk yesterday about the greens he said it reminded him of augusta in terms of the speed and the undulation mainly for dj and bryson because you played the course we touched on the length but where do you see the difficulties out there tomorrow and for the weekend,yeah i enjoy the game i've seen it a couple times on tv but watching it on tv especially when you don't know a sport or don't know a whole lot about it seeing it live was a lot better just to see what's all going on and understanding the game a little bit more i sat down with the premier for a few minutes and he explained to me kind of the game and so i understand it a lot better yeah it was fun and like he said it is a man's sport i'd like to,0
brooks koepka,1,2024-02,2024,135,0,1,1,graeme and talor basically you guys are the new additions to the team what are your ambitions what are your hopes what are you trying to achieve here at smash,obviously i think if you look at the group of guys that are here just as part of this league is what's going to draw kids i'm pretty sure that's how each one of us got involved you find your idol or a guy you like and you follow them and continue to watch them throughout the year or you come out and you get a chance to see them live and you come out and you fall in love with the game and you fall in love with a guy and you get to play a golf course that we've played i think that's pretty special and i think you can see the involvement since i first came here in i think a lot more kids are getting involved so that's a good thing,0
brooks koepka,1,2024-02,2024,194,0,1,1,brooks in terms of the liv jeddah tournament being held here year after year how do you think this is going to be more beneficial to the community how can the kids here pick up the sport more,i think it's pretty simple like talor said we wanted to put a group of guys that first off know how to win i think that's important you've got to be able to cross that finish line you've got guys that have been in those spots won major championships guys that are going to compete for them for years and years and guys that aren't afraid i think that's a huge thing you look at this whole team and i don't think anybody is going to back down they've got a chance to if they've got a chance to win they're going to put their foot on the pedal and go that's what we want it's also just a very easy group of guys to be around sitting around even for lunch just talking about random stuff life whatever it is i feel like we're all very close i've gotten with j over the last four of five years i've known g mac for years now been pretty close talor obviously just getting to know him even better more recently it's been the perfect addition i'm beyond thrilled and i'm happy to have them,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-10,2023,314,1,0,1,MODERATOR,yeah i think that brooks has played some of the best golf of anybody in the world this year he won the pga he played phenomenal in the majors played phenomenal out here just won last week like it's not there's a lot of other guys i would rather be playing against so i've got my work cut out for me but i have the utmost respect for him and any time i have a chance to play with him or against him i enjoy it he is always professional to play with play against and i expect that we are going to have a fun match but there's also a mutual respect between us that i believe we share and i think it's going to be you know very professional and i'm hoping that i can play some of my best golf because i know i need to to just make it competitive now that we know the team matchups we need to reveal the players that will be competing against each other now this is the first time we are going to be hearing of all of this i don't know who is playing against who either captains don't even know who the other captains have selected to play individual matches or the foursomes so this is going to be fun lots of great storylines as a reminder the captains will play each other in the individual match play so it is now time to reveal the individual matches first up stinger versus iron heads obviously we have louis versus kevin the other singles match will be branden grace versus scott vincent and that leaves us for the foursome with deane burmester charl schwartzel sihwan kim and danny lee louis we'll start with you how do you feel about the matchups what was your decision to not put branden in the foursomes,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-10,2023,87,0,1,1,MODERATOR,yeah i mean i don't have anything to say but compliments about brooks and his play and what he's done this year and what he's done for his own game but also for liv golf i'm excited for the opportunity to play against him but like i said there's a lot of other guys i'd rather play against he just won last week and he's played some exceptional golf and i'm going to have to bring out some of my best golf just to make me competitive,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-10,2023,195,1,0,1,did you seriously not know you would win an extra million on sunday and have you got some crap or that since,i guess i don't i'm just bringing like facts to life as to like why that's happening but really we as a group as a league that's trying to grow the game and bring it globally and promote the game throughout the world as well as bring something different than the old stodgy format that we've had for decades we just need to focus on what we are doing and make our product as good as possible as interesting as possible we need to make tweaks into our program the owgr need to obviously make tweaks but we need to tweak our format to continue to evolve and be more interesting and easier to understand we have enough on our plate to make our product more and more exciting and appealing that we shouldn't worry ourselves with what they are doing but i do want to bring to light as to why exactly they are doing what they are doing it's not what they are putting out there on the front page there's a lot more going on behind the scenes as to the importance of us to the getting points to the pga tour,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-10,2023,74,1,1,1,what was your reaction when you found out,i think that the majors need to protect their product and there's probably other ways that they can do that by creating slots if they want to make sure they have the best fields in golf they could create vehicles for players on liv to play in majors where they don't have to use the owgr which would undermine the tv contract and revenue of the pga tour if they gave points to liv,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-10,2023,137,1,0,1,is that a shame as a captain don't you think you should,i wasn't intentionally playing slow i know that in the ' pga final round brooks felt the same way but really all i was trying to do was get a visualization of the shot and get in kind of like my own little bubble and world maybe i was playing slow maybe i wasn't it wasn't my intent my intent was to get into a calm state and have good visualization and play my best golf and unfortunately i lost on the last hole to cam but look i'm going to be trying to do the same thing tomorrow i'm not trying to play slow i'm always saying look go ahead go ahead and hit like i'm not trying to throw you out of your rhythm but i don't want to be taken out of mine either,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-10,2023,75,0,1,1,my question is for phil we saw your reaction last week to the owgr ruling and i just wanted to follow on that to you they did open the door or leave open the possibility that liv could resubmit its bid or its application how do you feel about that do you feel that liv should reapply do you think that they should make the changes that they are sort of hinting at to try to comply whenever that might be,no he's not seen me on a course yet yeah he'll be him and jena are going to come down later in the week i don't think he's going to come to the course but it would be nice to finally i guess get done playing or get done practicing whatever it might be and get to go home and go spend time with him new experience for me so i'm looking forward to it,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-10,2023,57,0,1,1,are following up on what you said earlier you said liv needs to continue to evolve how would you like to see liv evolve now that you've seen it for one full season now,yeah listen i watched chase work over the last year and a half spent more time around him it's been fun for me to see him evolve grow as a person grow as a man i'd take him back in a heartbeat you know he's just got to go out and do play good simple as that,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-10,2023,159,1,0,1,you got cam last year and brooks this year two of the best players out here not the easiest draws you've had for match play cam said last year you had a little gamesmanship in your match and said you designed of took forever out there are you planning on using that again this year against brooks to try and slow him about a little bit,i think he's an incredible talent our team is very invested in his success and we want him to succeed we've enjoyed our time together so he's a great addition to the team and we're going to miss him if he's not on the team because of the many intangibles he brings but the reality is i've been fielding calls as we all have from players that are free agents to pga tour players to dp world tour players that want to come over you know the spot's probably going to be filled by the time the qualifying tournament is here so if i'm just being truthful that's a very real possibility and even if it is filled there's always the possibility of a trade to get him back there's ways this could work out but i think there's a good chance based on the number of calls that we've had that the spot will be filled fairly soon,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-10,2023,104,0,1,1,similar to what phil answered what is your stance on the situation with the world golf ranking points and the future with liv in those points,do i think that no i know that's going to happen when players look at liv they are wanting to be a part of it everybody here is happy and enjoying what we are doing and enjoying the team aspect of it and enjoying each other and the camaraderie and enjoying playing golf globally and all the benefits that come with playing this tour so there's a lot of players that see that and want to be a part of it the question is you know how many spots are available there's a lot more players that want to come than there are spots,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-10,2023,34,0,1,1,my question is for cam brooks phil and kevin na all four of you have teammates that are in the relegation spot there's going to be a promotion event that happens in a few weeks where they have one last chance to get in the top three to earn their spot back to liv golf next year if one of your guys is in one of three spots are you taking them back on your team cam phil kevin and brooks what do you think,there's a lot of players that could be signed not even through the qualifying you know there's spots on teams that are open that players want to come over and be a part of,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-10,2023,35,0,1,1,some low scoring out there today what's the game plan tomorrow to make it back to back wins at liv golf jeddah,just got to go play a good round of golf that's it just keep doing what i'm doing seems to be working since i'm at the top just go play good see what happens tomorrow,0
justin thomas,0,2023-10,2023,129,1,0,1,MODERATOR,i personally didn't think so i thought it was really great of zach and the pga to be accommodating to have us come over here and take a little scouting trip and i think that was obviously didn't show but felt it was very helpful it's a very very busy long week with very different routines and schedules that you would have in a normal week and this week the loss that we had this week has absolutely nothing to do with team camaraderie because this is probably the closest team i've ever been a part of we unfortunately just didn't play well enough kind of like max said earlier about sam i can't speak on behalf of everybody but i didn't feel the preparation was necessarily the issue,0
justin thomas,0,2023-10,2023,6,0,1,1,you said a little bit ago that this was the closest team you've ever been on curious now that this event is over is there some sort of example or moment this week that you guys pondered the most whether it was a laugh or a joke,living it up with the baby,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-09,2023,120,0,1,1,regarding brian harman i think you're viewed as one of the more mentally tough players out here and he obviously went through a lot of bs at liverpool to win that open championship this summer what's your take on him and how he's been overlooked a lot and he's got a chip on his shoulder a little bit because of that and he expressed that after the open championship,i love it i love guys with a chip on their shoulder i love guys that are very gritty gritty players that's something when i first came out that was who i kind of emulated i thought to me growing up it was dustin and then g mac i thought they were both well g mac was just especially gritty i don't want to say he's got to work a little bit harder than everybody else and always finds a way to get it done and i think brian is quite similar i think you can compare those games a little bit i just love that never gives up always battling to the end and ready to prove people wrong,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-09,2023,52,0,1,1,brooks when you decided to join liv last year was the ryder cup even on your radar and was there a point between then and now that it became in your mind a possibility,i mean i knew it would be tougher but i think after augusta i kind of had my eyes on it i realised i think after augusta i went to maybe th somewhere around there on the points list and then from there it was just motivation to get on the team,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-09,2023,63,0,1,1,do you think playing the team format in liv can make you a better ryder cup player or teammate in any way and you playing here this week do you feel like you're representing liv golf as well as the usa,i feel like i'm representing the usa that's what i've got on the front of my hat this week so that's what i'm representing it's not a group of individuals in that locker room we're just all one team and that's the way we think that's what i believe and i'm pretty sure everybody else there thinks that what was the other question,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-09,2023,92,0,1,1,do you think liv golf can make you a better ryder cup player,i mean you're just going to play a round of golf and then the team scores add up at the end i don't see how that has really any translation to this format yeah you're in a group setting or like a team setting but other than that i don't see how it's we're not playing alternate shot or best ball i think until miami in three weeks and that's just a match play you can only take care of yourself so i guess it would be like a sunday out here,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-09,2023,3,0,1,1,in terms of the liv side of it clearly you're conspicuous here as the only liv golfer,i didn't notice,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-09,2023,35,0,1,1,in terms of the selection policies zach has repeatedly said that all he did was look at the rankings clearly that doesn't favour the liv side for the obvious reasons but do you feel like the liv guys got a fair crack of the whip at selection,i don't make the decisions it doesn't everybody had an opportunity to get there i mean i had the same opportunity as every other liv player and i'm here play better that's always the answer,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-08,2023,56,0,1,1,in west virginia golf is a pretty popular sport here i'm sure you've see that with the galleries for you to be able to come here to this state what do you think the implications are for the kids and the rest of their lives when you think about something like that,yeah it's cool me i was a big sports nut so anytime i was able to go see somebody that i enjoyed whether it be baseball basketball golf football doesn't matter it kind of you find somebody to root for somebody to follow somebody to cheer on and i think that's what the world needs right,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-06,2023,147,1,0,1,MODERATOR,i played here a long time ago but i have really fond memories here with seve i had a really special relationship with seve i looked up to him as a kid and i had a chance to play a pga tour event with him in san diego and he was so kind so me and i really appreciated the time i spent with him and there were a lot of great memories from his captaincy in ' even though we lost by a point made a good sunday rally the memories i had were of seve leading his team and driving around the course and getting involved in what his players should do and try this shot and how creative he was i had a lot of great memories but a lot of them are from valderrama and i can't come here without thinking about him,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-06,2023,80,0,1,1,MODERATOR,it's aspirational it's not for everybody but it's a cool thing about her team and it's the creativity of my wife amy and what she brings we envision a lot of little kids running around the golf course in capes and that's kind of what we're hoping for and have them dreaming about being a hyflyer one day i know we're only one year into liv but where it's going to be in years it's going to be pretty exciting,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-06,2023,150,1,0,1,MODERATOR,yeah it pretty much jump started my career when i was over here on the challenge tour my first win was at the end of in spain and i think that kind of propelled me the next six months on the challenge tour which got me european tour and then was able to make the leap over to the pga tour it basically jump started my entire career you always look back at your first professional win and to me that meant a lot i think it definitely plays a role in everything i've done and like i've said it a million times it was the most fun i've ever had playing golf was traveling the world those early years and learning a lot learning about myself learning different countries learning different things it was so much fun i think it played a huge part in who i am today,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-06,2023,205,0,1,1,MODERATOR,it's been a pretty full schedule to me relative to what i was expecting it to be at playing events this year with the four majors and the liv events and playing in saudi arabia earlier this year so it's been a lot of golf but it's been fun because there's been enough breaks in between to where i get excited to get back out here we were talking with our teammates about how much we were looking forward to getting out here and playing and playing practice rounds together and competing again so there's enough of a time off in between where we get excited to get out here this is really a fun month for us to be over here in europe we've got two incredible liv events here this week at valderrama and next week in london before a little break to prepare for the british open i'm expecting a lot of players that aren't in the british to qualify and then there's a lot of players here that will be competing this will be an exciting month for the liv players as we really make a push to the second half of our season and it's been a lot of fun,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-06,2023,75,1,1,1,brooks you're currently in third place on the individual standings but it's really anybody's game it's a really tight race right now given your career accomplishments where would a season individual trophy kind of rank amongst all of your career accomplishments,i agree with both of them i think it's been fantastic i think you can see the way the schedule has played out how everyone has played in majors phil second i got second at the masters good showing by a bunch of liv guys at the pga and then the u s open as well i think the schedule has been fantastic it's definitely helped us in the preparation for the majors as well,0
dustin johnson,1,2023-06,2023,53,0,1,1,brooks you won twice in spain in your early years what do you remember of those years and how important were they for your wins recently,same for me all the guys i talk to that have played here said nothing but great things so i was excited to get here and once i saw the golf course it lived up to everything that people said about it yeah it's a fantastic golf course really excited for the week,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-06,2023,161,0,1,1,we've got this week and next before the next major i was curious how you've enjoyed balancing the liv schedule with the major schedule especially with the few countries we've played in,i think it's really a credit to robert trent jones sr who designed it and the way he made precision be such an important part of the test of golf rather than the ability to just overpower it so this is a great example when we talk about the golf ball going too far and so forth of how to create precision and ball striking and course management as the challenge rather than just brute strength the simplicity of the golf course the greens they're not over contoured they have just the right amount of movement they're small they're difficult the way each holes are shaped with the trees and the fairways moving you really have to be creative on club selection as well as shot making it's just a great overall test and it's not just about who hits the ball the longest it's about who can have the most complete golf game and it's really a great golf course,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-06,2023,80,0,1,1,brooks dj has there been much of a difference than previous years from a scheduling standpoint,i've been pretty happy with my decision to be here at liv i've enjoyed it i'm not going to speak for everybody else but i would say everybody is pretty excited and everybody is pretty happy with where they're at right now it's tough to look into the future and say i don't have any control over what other guys do but i know i'm happy where i'm at right now and just take it one day at a time,0
dustin johnson,1,2023-06,2023,57,0,1,1,dj did you as captain order the code red on pat perez's hair,yeah i'm excited for the future i think with this agreement the only thing that's going to happen is liv is going to get even better than what it is now which it's already great i'm happy exactly where i am and i'm definitely not looking to play more golf than i'm playing now that's for sure,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-06,2023,89,0,1,1,how excited have you been that you are playing here in spain at valderrama,somewhat i think that right now we have basically an agreement to have an agreement so there's really and everything over the last couple of years that we've been told by greg and everybody on liv has come to fruition so we have a lot of confidence in what they have been saying to us because everything has been happening we don't really feel the need to publicly posture our position there's really no need for us to talk about things publicly but to just let it play out,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-06,2023,33,1,1,1,with the framework agreement that was announced at the beginning of the month it seems like most people presume that you guys want to return to the pga tour yet just hearing you talk about how you prepared for the majors and the way the season flows it's actually a much better way for you guys just actually wondering if you do want to return to the pga tour in some form of fashion,i think actions are a little bit stronger than words i think if you just look at what liv is doing and what we're doing i think that is more of a statement,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-06,2023,63,0,1,1,oddly most people think that liv is going to go away they thought this agreement basically said that but you're talking about capes you're talking about the future it seems like all of you believe that this is going to be around for a while,rather than saying yes or no i know that from a player experience all of the difficulties and challenges and things that take a lot of excessive energy and output throughout the week have been fixed at liv so the player experience here is incredible i just can't envision a better scenario for me as a player than playing out here on liv,0
phil mickelson,1,2023-06,2023,129,1,1,1,phil about your links to spain you've been a long time without coming here but you have a good relationship with seve sergio and jon have you ever talked to them about the miracle of spanish golf very little players having major winners have you talked to them about that,i would say i felt appreciation that we got to this point where we're working together because it makes me confident with where the game of golf is headed in the future we felt like it was going to be about two years roughly before we got to that point it took a year and a half or six months quicker than i thought it would be going forward we're all very optimistic about where the game of golf professional golf specifically is headed also a lot of the changes that have been made because of liv were all very appreciative both on the liv tour as well as the pga tour and we're happy for the guys out there that they're having some positive changes there as well,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-06,2023,69,1,1,1,phil specifically do you have any interest in playing on the pga tour in the future,it's tough to speak for the european side i think that's we don't really have any involvement in that considering that we're all from the united states so it's very tough i think to be honest with you it's kind of unfortunate what happened i don't know we'll see hopefully there's a couple guys from liv that are playing the ryder cup here in three months so we'll see,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-06,2023,79,1,0,1,the pga tour guys expressed complete shock at the announcement were you guys as surprised on your side,yeah i think there was it was just kind of because we didn't hear anything about it i think that's the one thing that shocked everybody the most i think i ran into rickie and jt after watching the whole thing and i asked if they knew and they said they didn't know either they were kind of learning about it they were on the back of the range so i probably saw them minutes after the news broke,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-06,2023,41,1,0,1,if you rejoined the pga tour would you be interested in bringing in the team golf concept,i mean like i said i'm not going to go into the future i don't have a crystal ball with me i'm just worried about the u s open if i can get to no pretty quick that would be nice,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-06,2023,60,1,1,1,compared with when you were on your previous major tear i just wonder going into the third major of the year having been runner up at augusta winning at oak hill do you feel fresher because of the regime that you're on with liv compared to how it was on the pga tour,i have my own routine that's it it's plain and simple i'm pretty sure i know what it takes to compete in majors i've won five of them and been second four times and just over my track record how to prepare when you're here how to prepare when you're home for it i've got that i guess on lock,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-06,2023,3,0,1,1,it's no different playing a liv schedule going into these majors,just golf man,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-06,2023,31,1,1,1,we know one thing is there will be some kind of penalties or conditions or whatever for liv golfers coming back being reintroduced to the pga tour are you okay with that and do you think that will be okay,like i said it's a lot of what if games i'm not going to play the what if game if it happens it happens if it doesn't happen it doesn't happen,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-06,2023,126,1,0,1,i appreciate we're dealing with a lot of unknowns at the moment but in augusta you touched upon the fact you may have made a different decision months ago if you knew how your body was going to heal up would you be one player who would want to play pga tour golf again,yeah i mean there's always you have your favorite events i've always enjoyed waste management i thought that was a fun event but i think that kind of goes into the whole thing with like the chaos there's a lot of people a lot of things going on where it's a lot of fun to play i've enjoyed it i've won there twice that's one place i guess i miss playing but yeah i'd have to go through the whole schedule memphis i've always played well there's certain events you always liked even dunhill i've always liked dunhill i thought that was a fun event st andrews is my favorite course in the whole world so i'll take any chance i can to go play there,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-06,2023,73,0,1,1,aside from the courses are there things you miss about seeing pals of yours week in and week out,yeah absolutely we see some of the guys that just live in jupiter and play the same courses we see those guys but there's certain guys like for instance jon rahm he doesn't live down there so i don't get to see him too much and get to hang with him scottie kind of same thing it's those guys tant aren't in jupiter you kind of miss seeing them and playing against them,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-06,2023,123,1,0,1,at what point in your career did you decide that majors were the thing for you,i don't know probably growing up right at the end of the day i think one thing that was always kind of harped on me was you knew how many majors jack has you knew how many tiger has you knew how many arnold palmer has you knew how many gary player watson all these legends but i never knew how many pga tour events or wins they had total i could tell you going down the list each of them had won so that was kind of it's pretty obvious right that's what you're judged on it's major championships you look at basketball you're judged on how many championships you've won not how many games you've won same thing in every sport,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-06,2023,254,1,0,1,what was your first contention,it felt like contention to me but it probably wasn't it was at pinehurst was that kaymer won he blew us all away but i felt like i was in contention we were all playing for second place really that was kind of the first taste of it but i also got a taste of it kind of early on it was funny i qualified as an am for the u s open in i believe played there i think i had the lead after nine holes and then saw my name on the leaderboard and just gagged it up on the back nine it was like augusta all over again yeah so i understood the magnitude kind of right away of what it was but it was i think back to ' i played the final round of the pga with tiger too so i got introduced a lot early i felt like that kind of really helped learn different things like i feel like i'm really good at learning from mistakes or what goes on and i'll sit back and reflect for like two three days whether it be right after give it a few days and be really truthful honest with myself of why things happened the way they did what was my thinking what was my thought process how did i execute how i wanted to was it just kind of unlucky all that goes into it but if you're truly honest with yourself i think you'll figure out why,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-06,2023,67,1,0,1,if you played not to lose at augusta is that the first time that ever happened,i mean i can't give away what i was doing but yeah it didn't work clearly but i'll be honest with you i told you i told everybody at pga i was never going to let it happen again i know how to make adjustments and really figure out what goes on and that's i think probably one of my biggest attributes that i think i have,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-05,2023,201,0,1,1,at liv we really get to see the relationships that you guys have with your caddies because the caddies are part of the family here and you have a special relationship with ricky can you tell us what that moment was like for you guys,yeah ricky was the one that came out ricky and taylor were the ones that came out for my surgery as well i think my brother was playing in the honda classic so my parents wanted to watch him my wife had just had surgery on her ankle so she couldn't fly couldn't come out yeah it was a big it was kind of a disaster so it was kind of hard to find somebody to come because you had to have somebody there to drive you home so they came out and rick spent that whole time period basically three weeks out in la with me and yeah he gave up a lot for basically two years kind of dealt with me through the ups and downs i probably gave him too hard of a time during the lows at the end of the day he's the only one that wants to see me succeed more than i do he's got a vested interest in this and he's done a fantastic job he was in my wedding he's basically blood to me he's family he knows that i love the guy to death and i think he deserves it all,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-05,2023,113,1,0,1,speaking of celebrations you obviously enjoyed your time the last few days before you got here how was it to get to a course i don't know how much experience you have playing this course but to get here not really seeing much of it and still be able to shoot a respectable score today,yeah i mean i used to do it all the time in college golf junior golf you don't see a golf course you just go play it i did all right back i know that was years and years ago for me but it's part of it i've done it before on the pga tour i've done it a few times where i've had to play i think a couple courses just blind you've got other obligations but yeah i felt fine the golf course ricky walked the golf course so at the end of the day he's the one telling me where to hit it anyway so i just rely on him,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-05,2023,65,1,0,1,how difficult is it at all to kind of refocus on this tournament after winning the pga going and celebrating at the heat in florida and doing all that stuff and then coming here and refocusing,yeah it's just part of it just get back to somewhat of a normal routine it felt good just to play golf again kind of get it out of the way and hopefully play a little better the next few days knowing the golf course a little bit more knowing where to hit it where to miss it i don't know what was the lead,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-05,2023,93,1,0,1,with this team format you winning the pga does something like that lift up the entire tour do you think with all the guys not just you but all the guys finishing well,yeah it definitely sparks some energy into i think players caddies staff from the top down i think it definitely sparks energy if you really look at it from augusta until now i think we've really built momentum built a good just with good play that's all it's been to have three out of five guys i think top at augusta adelaide how many people were there the atmosphere there which was the best tournament to that time it just feels like everything is just rolling right now and that's a good thing,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-05,2023,99,0,1,1,non major weeks how are you living it up off the course when you're not playing we saw how you did this week that's probably not every week,probably not every week no you only get to celebrate the fifth one really that hard for a bit but most of the times just hanging out with my boys hanging with my wife hanging with friends doing whatever we want we go on the boat we just have a good time we just try to enjoy it and get away from golf my boys don't really play golf so they're down to do anything they just want to like i said go on the boat or do something like that play corn hole play some kind of game,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-05,2023,32,1,0,1,five majors three pgas given all you went through and the rehab and the doubts is this as sweet as any,yeah this is probably the sweetest one of them all because all the hard work that went into this one this one is definitely special this one is probably it for me,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-05,2023,56,1,1,1,bryson was talking about how this not validates the liv tour but was an important moment for your tour can you appreciate that with your victory here,yeah i definitely think it helps liv but i'm more interested in my own self right now to be honest with you yeah it's a huge thing for liv but at the same time i'm out here competing as an individual at the pga championship i'm just happy to take this home for the third time,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-05,2023,69,0,1,1,that was actually pretty much my question obviously the first ever and will always be the first ever representative from the liv tour to win a major is there any pride with that obviously you're playing individually but is there any pride as a representative of the organization,yeah i think so look at it i think i was the first guy to win two liv events to win a major is always a big deal no matter where you're playing all it does i just think i guess validates it for myself i guess maybe if anybody doubted it from augusta or whatever any doubts anybody on tv might have or whatever i'm back i'm here,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-05,2023,29,1,0,1,would you want to see the pga championship coming back to oak hill and you playing in it one day,like i said i love new york it's treated me pretty well but three of the five have been in new york so i'll come back any time smiling,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-05,2023,25,1,0,1,the five majors now three pgas given all you went through and rehab and doubt is it as sweet as any,this is probably the sweetest one of them all just because of all the hard work that had to go into this one it's special,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-05,2023,105,1,0,1,brooks i was actually the one that asked you that question so i'll go with something different do you feel that a course like oak hill the toughness of it sets up that game plan for you do you feel you're flying a little under the radar this week i bet you like that,i don't know about flying under the radar i haven't really paid much attention i've been pretty busy this week i like the golf course i think it's good i like the older style golf courses i think it's very very tough with the rough it's kind of a mixture of a pga and u s open i think you miss greens out here you're going to make a lot of bogeys you miss fairways you're going to be making quite a few bogeys if you're out of position you have to hit fairways the golf course can be tough especially if this wind blows,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-05,2023,113,0,1,1,zach johnson was in here our u s ryder cup captain and was talking specifically about you guys the liv guys one of the questions was how he is going to figure out if he would pick you guys or not because it's going to be pretty hard as you know with points to get on the team in the top the question is do you think about that are you interested in that how concerned are you about trying to get on the team,i mean it would be awesome to represent the united states anytime we do it it's always fun but i'm not focused on it it's not like my first thought when i go play well this week if i handle my business out here everything will take care of itself if you win go second first first first it would be kind of tough not to pick right if you go handle business i feel like i should be fine but it's not up to me it's up to zach and what goes on i just play my best and see what happens from there but i would love to play for him,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-05,2023,27,1,0,1,you're not on the pga tour anymore so now you can talk openly about how bad the slow play is how big a problem is it how would you fix it,i mean yeah it's never quick i was talking about it when i was on the pga tour too so i'm not afraid to talk about it,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-05,2023,76,0,1,1,matt i asked the oklahoma state guys this yesterday and i'll ask you the same question can you take us back through the recruiting process and how you got to oklahoma state who influenced you the most that sort of thing,no honestly a major i'm so focused and i mean honestly the crazier things are the more it slows down for me the more focused i get the more tunnel vision i have i feel like a lot of great athletes have that same thing the more chaotic everything is going on around the slower everything is for me that's what i live for i live for the majors and that's where i'm trying to perform,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-05,2023,26,1,1,1,brooks going from a liv golf tournament event like this to the pga championship different vibes between the two with the music and the crazier crowds does it take some adjustment as a golfer to go from this directly to a pga championship,i feel good i feel great worked hard over the last few months to make sure that we don't have any problems so i feel good,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-05,2023,139,1,0,1,how are you feeling,i played it actually it was the first time ricky ever caddied for me he showed up minutes late i can't believe he's still with me but we worked it out yeah it'll be what years since we've been back it's my first pga championship i know i played with tiger in the final round and all my boys came a bunch of them were from boston so they were all pissed off because they couldn't see anything they were all mad they were hoping i'd have somebody else so they could watch some golf shots it was a cool week a fun week for me it'll be cool to go back i know the golf course has changed been redesigned a little bit i don't think there's as many trees but it'll be cool for me and rick,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-04,2023,57,0,1,1,brooks you said at the masters recently that your decision to join liv was based around your health condition at the time do you still stand by this decision given how you're enjoying life on liv golf now,i think i think it would have made my decision you can't play what ifs that's the whole thing i was hurt so this is the situation i've been in i don't know could it have been different yeah that's pretty much what i said but like i said at augusta i'm pretty happy with my decision,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-04,2023,61,0,1,1,MODERATOR,but would love to do that we went to one of the afl games on sunday night i know me and dustin did so that was quite fun just getting to see it live anytime you watch guys do what they're amazing at and it's a cool sport it's fun it's a real sport those guys beat each other like crazy,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-04,2023,98,1,0,1,MODERATOR,i don't know if there's any other i don't know i haven't spoken to anybody that's on that level to be like hey are you coming over to play it's not my style it's not usually how i approach anybody look i'm sure there's a bunch of guys who are still looking to come over whether that be college players younger players to guys that play on the pga tour or dp tour i'm sure there are people looking to join but yeah you can always add depth to anything the stronger we get the better we are,0
dustin johnson,1,2023-04,2023,54,0,1,1,MODERATOR,yeah i think same obviously the better players we have playing obviously the stronger liv gets and it's better for the game as far as i haven't talked to greg this week so i don't know i can't really comment too much on what he was saying i didn't see what he said either,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-04,2023,83,0,1,1,MODERATOR,keegan matt fitzpatrick patrick cantlay lives on the same street fowler does as well i could run into tour guys if i wanted to in a day and nobody has really had any negative feedback any negative thing to say and that would be the time to say it but i think it was good just for the fans to see that we still communicate we still play together we still practice together do everything the exact same we're still the same people,0
dustin johnson,1,2023-04,2023,137,0,1,1,MODERATOR,yeah i'm the same obviously where we live i think half the golf world lives in south florida i see all the guys all the time it was nice to see at augusta see a few of the guys that you don't see in jupiter or out here on liv a couple buddies i got to see and hang out with but yeah the fans were great heard a lot of go aces and i think they were really good at augusta obviously that is one place where fans are always very respectful they don't really have a choice either but yeah it is the masters and i think everyone just respects augusta and the masters it's more about the golf than what tour you play on i think that's how it should be all the time,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-04,2023,127,0,1,1,MODERATOR,yeah i definitely have just from being at the game on sunday night to just being around for the last two days you see a lot of people just passing by you either in the hotel or things like that and at the game i think it's fantastic i think everyone is just super appreciative that we made the trip down here and we're playing because like you said it's been a long time since anybody has really been able to see the quality of field that i think we're bringing this week it's exciting it's going to be a big thing for cam's team the rippers it's going to be a big thing for liv and a big thing for australia and i think that's amazing,0
dustin johnson,1,2023-04,2023,88,0,1,1,greg earlier this week suggested that there's a long list of players queueing up to join the tour i just wondered if you guys had got any feedback about player feeling at the masters and as greg suggested do you concede that this tour still needs further depth to make it more viable,extracurricular it's a clothing company they're making all the clothes for the aces i think they also do all the merchandise for liv but it's just a new company and yeah we partnered with them and yeah they make great stuff i'm excited we just got a new shipment of shirts for this week but it's kind of just getting started so it's all kind of new it's going to continue to get better the stuff we're making right now is great and i really like wearing it,0
dustin johnson,1,2023-04,2023,1,1,1,1,just a question to all of you from the masters experience it seems that you guys were generally welcomed there within the cohort and also the fans do you all sense i guess a bit of a thawing not so much between the pga and liv but from a fans' perspective and your cohorts do you think the relationships are thawing now particularly sold out crowds here aussies are a pretty pragmatic bunch your thoughts on that,yeah,0
dustin johnson,1,2023-04,2023,171,0,1,1,following on from that a little bit you guys are now in the second season you've got a feel for liv how it's been received how big do you think this tour can get what would be your optimum number of players how many tournaments each year would you like to see where can it go,yeah i mean like i was saying earlier definitely driving because you've got to be able to you've got to hit it out of the fairway here because you've got to control the golf ball coming into the greens because they are fast they are undulated i think if you obviously got a bunch of rain on saturday but the fairways are still firm and fast greens are they're a little soft i think but they're fast if they can get those a little bit firmer i think that's the defense of the course with all the run offs around the greens like i said if you're coming from the fairway obviously you can control the ball a lot better i think that's kind of the defense is the narrow fairways the rough and obviously having firm fast undulating greens is going to that's where it but if you're driving it well the course plays pretty short you can definitely shoot some good scores but if not you're going to struggle,0
dustin johnson,1,2023-04,2023,98,0,1,1,i was just wondering i heard phil talk yesterday about the greens he said it reminded him of augusta in terms of the speed and the undulation mainly for dj and bryson because you played the course we touched on the length but where do you see the difficulties out there tomorrow and for the weekend,yeah i enjoy the game i've seen it a couple times on tv but watching it on tv especially when you don't know a sport or don't know a whole lot about it seeing it live was a lot better just to see what's all going on and understanding the game a little bit more i sat down with the premier for a few minutes and he explained to me kind of the game and so i understand it a lot better yeah it was fun and like he said it is a man's sport i'd like to,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-04,2023,89,0,1,1,i know you probably won't like the liv questions but with you near the top and phil up there and patrick near the top what do you guys think you proved this week about the quality of play on that circuit,i think it's the best tournament in the world and i think everybody put on a pretty good display you know phil what did he shoot today under that's pretty impressive spieth p reed cameron young i think me and viktor were the only ones to shoot over par but the way jon played today was pretty impressive i don't know the game it's so good right now everybody it's amazing to see all these guys compete when they are at their best they are all tough to beat,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-04,2023,42,1,1,1,do you hope from the performance of everyone both the liv golf and the pga tour that this shrinks the fracture in the sport from a fan's perspective,i just toed it on trying to hold it so that's probably never good and then i guess was left and then so i guess they were i don't know man if i knew i would have fixed it out there smiling,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-04,2023,72,1,0,1,when you look at guys like talor gooch and harold and how the world rankings might be their only pathway back into these majors what do you think has to change to ensure that the majors do have all the best players in the world,probably not not today probably not for the next few days but eventually it will be a positive i'd say probably give it a week and i'll start to see some positives out of it and carry this over to the pga the u s open and the open but right now it's kind of tough to see if i'm honest probably for the next few hours and the next few days,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-04,2023,121,0,1,1,when you said last week that you missed playing against rory and scottie and the like how much of that is playing against them like being around or practice rounds or whatever and how much of it was like competing at this highest level,i think it's all just competing i see those guys down at the grove all the time i see the guys at medalist i see guys just out and about practicing i think there's probably about what six of us that live probably within a quarter mile of each other so we end up running into each other a good bit but it's just competitively where you miss playing against them right because you want rory to play his best and scottie to play his best and jon to play his best and go toe to toe with them i do miss that and that's one thing that i do miss and that's what i think makes these majors so cool,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-04,2023,4,0,1,1,if you had been this healthy at the time would the liv decision have been more challenging,sorry the first part,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-04,2023,22,0,1,1,if you had been as healthy as you are right now would the liv decision been more challenging,honestly yeah probably if i'm being completely honest i think it would have been but i'm happy with the decision i made,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-04,2023,4,0,1,1,you've been unapologetic in the past about your feelings toward the majors versus the regular tour events that you prepare for these and maybe not prepare as much for the other ones considering that and all the pressure the focus that you put on the majors is there more added pressure to perform in these given the sort of uncertain status of the future of liv golfers in the majors particularly with augusta national i think your exemption would run out if you don't perform after next year,what did you say,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-04,2023,50,0,1,1,you said break free can you tell us when you felt like you got out of being injured and and second does limited schedule the limited schedule of liv did it help you get through some of this,yeah we looked at it when we got back in gw and butchie had no idea what we were hitting they didn't even know because i know that fact because gw asked me what we hit walking off when we were walking down so that's all i can give you,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-04,2023,34,1,1,1,preparing for a tournament like a regular tournament doesn't matter if it's pga tour or liv tour and masters or majors mentally is there any difference for you particularly everybody said you're like you know big events player,yeah for sure i just thought about it walking off i just figured i had missed so many short ones and i just want to make the next few short ones so worked on,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-04,2023,109,0,1,1,but you also have a team on liv,not as much because i think his injury is a lot worse than mine but definitely three weeks after when we played in ' it was all about i was just trying to figure out the best areas to talk because this place is quite hilly for me it was downhill was a killer because my knee would get in front of my heel and that's where the mpfl that's stitched is still in there would just tighten and everything was quite painful but i don't have to worry about that anymore which has been great it's nice not having to think about where to walk around this place,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-04,2023,40,0,1,1,i know you've always traditionally put your emphasis on majors the fact that you've won at orlando two days ago must bode well considering you don't play as many events on the liv golf tour are you thinking the momentum coming into this thing is going to be something you could ride,yeah i hope so winning's pretty good look i've played five events this year i think usually i'd play six coming into this so i've played enough golf and i'm ready it's the masters so you get up for it,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-04,2023,112,1,1,1,people who have seen rory be very outspoken very pro pga tour and have spoken about the liv tour is it a good sign for people to see you guys playing together and they think oh this is a good step forward would you agree with that just to the public eye,i guess you could say that it's more just two friends just wanting to play together i guess you could look at it that way but yeah i just wanted to play with him just compare my game i know he's been playing well so it was good for me to see and i think it's fun to be able to go play with these guys we haven't played with these guys in a long time so just getting out to go play with them has been nice because it's been a lot of just seeing everybody it's been probably i don't know eight months since we've seen a lot of guys,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-04,2023,53,0,1,1,between liv and this tournament do you see a difference around the golfers,no i think this tournament everyone is just focusing on the task at hand that's certainly my mentality it was nice to say hi to some of the guys i hadn't seen in a while still wouldn't say i have a particularly close relationship with any of the players but we were cordial,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-04,2023,112,0,1,1,so much of golf is repetition routine going through your patterns and everything because the liv tour is quite different in its approach are you going to prepare or feel that anything needs to be worked on going to augusta readapting to the life you had before,i mean it's just one week i mean the only thing i can really say is maybe that's kind of why i played saudi and oman i just felt like three events wasn't enough going into augusta so playing those two events for four days as well just getting more acclimated to playing golf five months off is a long time i've done it a lot over the last four or five years with injuries and it takes a minute to get comfortable again and playing after that long of a period off look i'm happy i'm playing good i'm just going to keep doing what i've been doing my entire career,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-04,2023,88,0,1,1,are there any concerns at all because the fans are all going to be polite but is there any concern that maybe you don't have that same vibe from the fans just because the people who may not embrace liv is that a factor at all or can you put anything like that out,i'm going to be honest with you when i play i'm in my own bubble yeah i hear some things i heard somebody chirp me all the way down he actually came up with a good chirp so i was impressed with that i hear some things but it doesn't matter i'm not interested in what anybody is saying on the sidelines they can't affect me i've got more will to try and win and play my best than what anybody else is going to say or do,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-04,2023,92,1,0,1,obviously a win is a win but it was kind of mentioned yesterday you won now for the first time in about years in your home state is there any added significance to that,like i said it's just ricky's hometown orlando usually when i was playing the pga tour i couldn't find my game until pretty much the players that was kind of the first time where it was like all right just some off time a little rust shake it off but yeah i don't think i didn't play too much of the florida swing really just when i was playing the pga tour it was honda and pretty much players so that was it didn't really have many chances in the home state,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-04,2023,131,0,1,1,obviously you're the first two time winner at liv and everybody here knows how much the win in jeddah meant to you we all know that injuries it meant a lot personally to you but i want to talk about this win you're healthy now is it safe to say brooks koepka is back because when he's back it's scary for everybody especially during major season how are you feeling going into augusta do you feel like you did three four years ago,yeah i feel like i'm getting there you know it's tough right that was some of the best golf i've ever played yeah i do feel like i'm creeping up on that there's not much of a difference i'm controlling the ball the way i want to moving it left to right right to left and i'm putting good again i've worked hard with jeff pierce over the last few months on that getting a little more comfortable going back watching video just how things were in ' and ' and i've got no doubt that i'll return to that form i just don't know whether it's going to be right now in two months whatever it's going to be but i'm damn near knocking on the door if not here,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-04,2023,127,1,1,1,i know greg norman had mentioned today to a news outlet in australia that if one of the guys wins in augusta the other he'll make sure that they are there on the green congratulating the liv winner do you think that you guys are fighting for something more than yourself at augusta obviously it's probably one of the if not the most highly anticipated masters of all time you and the liv guys are you going to feed off each other are you hungrier this is really the first time we've seen pga and liv guys in a tournament together not only just a regular tournament but it's a major,yeah it'll be great just to see all the good players back back in one field again right it's the first time we've seen it in a long time that'll be exciting i'm looking forward to it just to see everybody and compete against them because at the end of the day i'll be honest i do miss playing against rory i do miss playing against scottie and i'm sure they miss playing against us as well that's a fact you always want to play against the best that's going to make augusta even more special but yeah i think if one of the liv players does win i think it'll be definitely a huge statement for liv and i know that all what is it guys,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-04,2023,58,0,1,1,how special if any would it be to win this event in your home state,yeah it would be nice obviously my family is here so yeah to be able to win anytime you win in your home state and win where everything is close by is pretty cool and know a lot of people rick lives here so that's a big thing as well it would be nice to squeak one out,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-04,2023,54,0,1,1,the first nine regular season events in liv there's not been a second time winner you're obviously on the verge of doing that why do you think that's been obviously it's a small sample size do you feel like there's something there with the quality of the fields the depth that type of thing,i think you just said it there's nine events right it's kind of tough to have multiple wins in nine events if you do you're doing something right don't care what tour you're playing on where you're at if you win twice in nine events that's pretty good i'm sure it'll happen here soon,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-03,2023,87,0,1,1,MODERATOR,yeah good day got off to a bad start again i bogeyed the first i think i've done that in every liv event i don't know what's wrong just sitting around for minutes and got to figure that out but yeah i played really well responded nicely and made a few putts it's nice to see the team finally playing well chase played well and then matt has been doing what he's been doing just nice to see us actually compete and hopefully we're there on sunday,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-03,2023,22,1,0,1,MODERATOR,well i usually play the week before the u s open and the pga so yeah that's done all right for me,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-03,2023,1,0,1,1,it would be a big statement for liv wouldn't it if they did have the masters champion and the open champion,facts,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-03,2023,75,0,1,1,a lot of people have asked there's three major champions right there in front of us for one of you guys or one of the that's going to compete next week in augusta if one of those guys wins augusta and brings quote unquote a green jacket back to liv what does that do for your teams what does it do for the aces what does it do for smash and what does it do for range goats because there's so much branding going in with your teams' logos can you talk a little bit about that,i think that's one of the big things down in jupiter we see each other i was just with rory and j t yesterday and i think keegan was there we see each other quite a bit i mean there's a lot of conversations i was talking with rory for probably about minutes just about the ball and all the other stuff that's going on no one is angry at anybody from what i've seen,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-03,2023,60,1,1,1,bubba you talked a little bit about how you kind of were able to be behind the scenes be in those meetings to see the future how to grow this can you talk a little bit about what those meetings were like and how do you continue to grow liv and just expand to make it not have the awkward conversations of what it goes along with the pga and just growing it from there,that is pretty much exactly what happened i'm going to be dead honest i was involved in a lot of these meetings and it's quite interesting i think bubba just hit on pretty much every topic that we've talked about from year year plan of where we want to be and i think that was actually a really good summary,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-01,2023,32,0,1,1,we can't let you go without talking about the majors how are you looking at that obviously augusta national is always the masters but the other three courses what do you think about them and have you played them in the past how have you done la country club royal liverpool and obviously oak hill,yeah i haven't really i don't think too much about it augusta u s open is in la i believe and from there i don't really where did you say it was,0
brooks koepka,1,2023-01,2023,129,1,1,1,oak hill for the pga and royal liverpool for the open,i've played them both it changes so much from year to year right whatever game plan you think you're going to go in with it's different weather it's raining windy you can't sit here in february and try to predict what's going to happen months from now like i said just try to get my game in the best shape possible before augusta or whatever we end up going to and i feel like as long as my game is where it should be ball striking putting chipping making sure that's why you play that's why i'm playing this week and next week trying to make sure whatever little mistakes i'm making this week next week doesn't creep into augusta you want to fix those as quickly as possible,0
brooks koepka,1,2022-10,2022,4,0,1,1,for all four captains just going from two days of match play to now stroke play all four rounds count that's the first time that's happened in a liv round what's the mentality in making switch from match play to stroke play dj maybe start first,add a couple zeros,0
dustin johnson,1,2022-10,2022,77,0,1,1,brooks you guys are on a roll right now just the mentality of switching back to stroke play you have four strong guys playing well now,but yeah for us it's all about the competition we want to win the first championship of liv golf and yeah i mean it's all about tomorrow it's anybody's ballgame i don't think there's every team up here obviously is playing well there's no favorites in my eyes tomorrow you know it's what four guys can play the best on the teams obviously because all four scores count so everybody on your team has to play well,0
dustin johnson,1,2022-10,2022,54,0,1,1,not really sure who to send this question to but if any of you want to speak up go for it do any of you feel a sense of rivalry with any other team in this league or any other golfer in this league and if not how do you see rivalry being created manifesting in the league,it would be great obviously it's the first liv team championship it's kind of the first year of this and i think it's gone really well and it just kind of sets up for things to come yeah i think it would be amazing and it's something that we all really want to win,0
cameron smith,1,2022-10,2022,72,0,1,1,how much,it wouldn't really bother me to be honest i think like all other events i don't know if it's the same for these guys but i spend more time looking at the team leaderboard than i do the actual individual leaderboard so i don't know it's quite unique but that's what i love about liv golf it's just so different and you're worried about your mates sometimes more than you are yourself,0
brooks koepka,1,2022-10,2022,31,0,1,1,i was wondering if every team in the liv tour was to play in a beer pong tournament who would win,yeah i mean i think we've all played so much golf together it doesn't really matter all three of them are pretty damn good players i'll take any one of them,0
phil mickelson,1,2022-10,2022,55,1,0,1,MODERATOR,let me just clarify that he doesn't have to pick from the last four he can pick from all seven teams so if you want a rematch of like the ' pga you could pick our team and we could play each other i'm just clarifying the rules because i don't know if everybody understands,0
phil mickelson,1,2022-10,2022,282,0,1,1,MODERATOR,from a team perspective this was a pretty easy decision for us because bernd and cameron play a very similar game they play a very similar golf ball and they look at the golf course the same way so this is going to keep them in their same element same strategy their caddies get along really well and are very close and i think that it's going to kind of lead to a cohesiveness and like a game plan our alternate shot foursome team was pretty easy to set especially when you look at matt wolff and how being one of the longest players on liv if not well bryson is out here but right behind bryson he's hitting the ball in places that we just don't see he's got so much firepower that when he gets in a groove and he gets it going we've seen throughout the liv events that he shoots some scores on some very challenging courses and this is one of them his length allows him to see this golf course totally different in a much more aggressive frame of mind i love his game for match play because he's going to be able to take advantage of a lot of the holes and make birdies get at some of these pins despite the water despite the challenges because he'll be coming at it with a much shorter club i really like him in singles and i really like bernd and cameron together and the cohesiveness that they provide then cameron smith and i will all naturally be irrelevant is the game plan like that's our plan but we are still going to play we'll still play,0
phil mickelson,1,2022-10,2022,151,0,1,1,phil you seem cautious to maybe not sledge or intimidate cam too much is there a reason behind that do you not want to wake the snake,well first of all what a great win he had last week he played some great golf i think it was an impressive victory but just maybe i shouldn't have said stuff like that i don't know but if i'm just looking at liv golf and where we are today to where we were six seven months ago and people are saying this is dead in the water and we're past that and here we are today a force in the game that's not going away that has players of this caliber that are moving professional golf throughout the world and the excitement level in the countries around the world of having some of the best players in the game of golf coming to their country and competing it's pretty remarkable how far liv golf has come in the last six seven months i don't think anybody can disagree with that,0
phil mickelson,1,2022-10,2022,111,1,1,1,phil a couple of weeks ago you said you saw liv trending upwards and pga tour trending downwards i'm not sure if you saw but rory mcilroy came out and said that that's just propaganda on your behalf can you speak to that,first of all those numbers can be very confusing for them what the range finders does is it really helps me because i don't have yardages on sprinklers from other fairways so when i get over there i have a much more committed swing because i know exactly how far it is otherwise we're trying to angle it it's just a lot of work to get yardages to one hole from two fairways let alone three and lasers just give me that freedom it's no coincidence that the first time lasers were ever allowed on the pga tour was the pga championship in look how that ended up it's no coincidence,0
brooks koepka,1,2022-10,2022,116,1,1,1,just a question for phil it's another one on the rory mcilroy interview in the guardian today he's spoken more generally about it and said this us versus them thing has gotten way out of control already and he's encouraging some level of kind of reconciliation i suppose i'm wondering from your perspective what that needs to look like and how this whole situation moves forward,yeah it's super nice to be able to drive an hour and minutes down the road and be able to get here i mean i don't know how many guys i'd say in this field there's probably that live in jupiter so it's convenient and i think a lot of us have just played it if you've grown up in florida playing junior golf tournaments or just playing it for fun and then obviously the pga tour was here for years played it quite a bit and feel comfortable but like you said it's nice to have family friends be able to come to an event when they don't get to see us play too much,0
brooks koepka,1,2022-10,2022,91,0,1,1,MODERATOR,i mean it's been before liv when i blue my knee out and my foot was pointed that way almost backwards and sideways credit to dr elattrache throw his name out there i still i mean eventually i'm going to have to have knee replacement in a few years but i didn't know what was i wasn't sure whether i could even move the same way and if i want to play if i could move the way i wanted i'm fortunate be in the spot that i'm in right now,0
brooks koepka,1,2022-10,2022,47,0,1,1,MODERATOR,i mean i enjoyed it i still think it's probably the most fun i've had playing golf was to probably playing in europe it was the most fun got to travel the world and to get to do it for a living i think it's pretty cool,0
brooks koepka,1,2022-10,2022,88,0,1,1,you're coming off your best result last week at liv did you see this coming a trending upward type of thing,yeah i did i think last week was kind of a turning point for me i've worked pretty hard with claude with pete and jeff over these last few months getting back together with claude and getting to see pete a bit more so this is the first time i've played back to back weeks since february so tough to build a rhythm i could see it coming i'm very pleased with it pleased with last week and you know hopefully just put together two more good rounds,0
brooks koepka,1,2022-10,2022,59,0,1,1,obviously you've participated in the kingdom before but this is the first time liv golf is here how do you see the live golf being here for the first time in the middle east,it's good to be back i haven't been back in three years i think was the last time i was here the golf course hasn't changed but it's fun to be back it's an exciting golf course you can make plenty of birdies but overall i mean everybody here has been nothing but polite respectful it's been a joy,0
brooks koepka,1,2022-09,2022,10,0,1,1,the liv setups so far haven't been extremely gettable how does it match up with both of your expectations coming into liv and how it's played out through almost five events now,it's pretty energized i mean it's golf but louder right,0
brooks koepka,1,2022-06,2022,31,0,1,1,MODERATOR,you play anywhere around the world you'll be just fine you'll get into them i made a decision i'm happy with it and whatever comes of it i'll live with it,1
brooks koepka,1,2022-06,2022,6,1,0,1,brooks throughout this whole process you were vocal in your support for the pga tour in the past what changed,no i don't know it's irrelevant,1
brooks koepka,1,2022-06,2022,161,1,0,1,patrick you said listen to the players for once for what the pga tour could have done what were some of the things that you felt like you weren't listened to on,i mean look i came back to play three weeks after surgery on a knee where they're like you're not going to play for six months just because i didn't feel like i was going to miss the whole season next season it was just bad timing where now i mean got what seven more events to play i mean you're not doing a month on the road anymore you know life does go on even though when we're not playing golf so being away from home for a month i don't have any kids that i know about so being at home is not really a thing for me but life does go on and like there's some things we miss at home being friends family a lot of birthdays it would just be nice to be home a little bit more i think that's a big thing that everybody every one of these players will say the same thing,1
brooks koepka,1,2022-06,2022,10,1,0,1,knowing the level of questions you guys are going to be asked this week after seeing everything that happened over in the london event i'm curious how much media training have you been given in order to answer those questions about whether it's the human rights abuses or the things going on with the pga tour or dp world tour as well,i don't know i'm just giving you an answer man,1
brooks koepka,1,2022-06,2022,95,0,1,1,given the historical significance of the caddie foundation francis ouimet how important was the caddie today and the relationship you have with them and of course this hitting in tough conditions,i love ricky where ricky has been on the bag for probably maybe eight years he is an important part of my life on the golf course and off and i think it's a cool relationship we've had he lives up in orlando two hours away ended up going up there to see him sometimes he'll come down and see me he is one of my groomsmen in my wedding so we're extremely close he kind of knows what i'm doing before i even do it it's a good relationship it's fun i appreciate it,1
brooks koepka,1,2022-06,2022,88,1,0,1,brooks i asked this at the pga championship sorry to repeat myself you've played once since the masters you got married have you played enough to be in form to win this week,yeah i've practiced enough i haven't played tournament golf yeah the only one was the pga but i can take time off and still come back and win it's not an issue if i grind like i have obviously the wedding week i didn't play or practice but i got back into it right after rick came down we spent four days at medalist four days with him at medalist just grinding making sure everything is where it needs to be i like where my game is at,1
brooks koepka,1,2022-06,2022,40,0,1,1,chase played last week in the first liv event what do you make of the current landscape it seems the two tours are fracturing the game at the top level,obviously liv is trying to make a big push for golf look i mean i love my brother i support him in anything he does it's family i'll always love and support him whatever he does i'm cheering for him,1
brooks koepka,1,2022-06,2022,16,1,0,1,why have you decided stay on the pga tour and is that a permanent decision,there's been no other option to this point so where else are you going to go,1
brooks koepka,1,2022-06,2022,75,0,1,1,liv,as of last week that's it i wasn't playing last week i'm here i'm here at the u s open i'm ready to play u s open and i think it kind of sucks too you are all throwing this black cloud over the u s open it's one of my favorite events i don't know why you guys keep doing that the more legs you give it the more you keep talking about it,1
brooks koepka,1,2022-06,2022,50,1,0,1,sorry to ask another question about it but not sorry enough not to do that in some ways it seems like they're offering something that would appeal to you you're a guy who really gets up for the majors really loves the majors at the moment it seems like it would be an opportunity to play less in between the majors and still play the majors is that attractive to you or do you prefer your current setup,i can come out here and play as little weeks as i want i choose my own schedule regardless what tour i play i can come out here i haven't played i've played what match play augusta pga and this one so i can play as little as i want,1
brooks koepka,1,2022-02,2022,75,0,1,1,kind of neat seeing peter's name on the board today i know you used to live right down the road can you take us back to those days and what it was like for you two dreaming big,yeah to probably i think he bought his place in maybe then kind of after about a year of challenge tour we were traveling around rooming together it was me him scott pinkney trying to think there might have been one other guy but yeah we had a lot of fun in europe together it was fun it's nice to see him play well and hopefully he played well the remainder of the three days,0
brooks koepka,1,2022-02,2022,74,1,0,1,is it a little bit of a nice feeling is there a different kind of vibe or do you get right into the zone when you're out there and it feels like another pga tour tournament or is it in the back of your head that you're at home,i think you've got to take a break somewhere it's pretty tough you figure you've got tiger's event next week bay hill players got to take a week off somewhere i think going from west coast to east coast guys don't want to do that like i said i think being a home game is more difficult than being on the road seems like a good week to take off and i understand it,0
brooks koepka,1,2022-02,2022,58,0,1,1,i know you have a strong commitment to playing in this tournament every year but you're from here what do you make of a lot of the big name golfers who live here but don't play in it,yeah i remember getting it i was still living with i had just moved into the house i was living at i was living with pete uihlein and matt broome i mean it was the first one i had ever gotten anytime you get a handwritten note somebody took the time to do it so that's always special,0
brooks koepka,1,2022-02,2022,56,1,0,1,brooks on this golf course in particular the bear trap always gets the attention but on the front side and played just as difficult if not more than the bear trap what makes it so difficult out there on and,yeah i mean i skimmed it over i'm happy with the pga tour i think everybody out here is happy he can think whatever he wants to think man he can do whatever he wants to do i think everybody out here is happy i think a lot of people out here have the same opinion,0
brooks koepka,1,2022-02,2022,30,1,0,1,i saw your instagram comment but i wanted to ask you if you could elaborate on what you thought when you read phil mickelson's comments about the pga tour and his position on their obnoxious greed,i said what i said i don't need to say anything more you take it how you want i know what i meant by it but it's up to you,0
brooks koepka,1,2022-02,2022,229,1,0,1,you're a guy with a lot of mainstream sports fans there is a lot of those kind of fans out here at this tournament that being said what does this tournament mean to the tour how important is it given how it relates to mainstream golf fans,well first off i think it brings a whole new group of fans to golf i think that's important i think you look at i mean i don't know the numbers i don't want to screw it up but i mean it's pretty much the biggest tournament we have on the pga tour as far as fans people the presence the atmosphere is unbelievable i love it look i love when people get rowdy they're cheering you when you hit it tight and they're booing you when you hit it bad it almost feels like a real sport like football basketball things like that soccer if you do something wrong you deserve to get heckled if you do something right they will cheer for you i think that's what makes this event so cool i understand why some guys don't like it they don't agree with or they just don't play it i guess because they don't like it it's something i have always loved then the th hole is just i think it's just so much fun i enjoy it is kind of becoming bigger as well with the grandstands they have got down on the left hand side this whole tournament has grown thunderbirds have done a tremendous job making this i think one of the i think that's why they call it the people's open right,0
brooks koepka,1,2022-02,2022,64,1,0,1,when you talk to the other players how much talk is there about the rivalry saudis all this other stuff or is it something you not discuss with fellow pros,it's been pretty clear for a long time now that i'm with the pga tour it's where i'm staying i'm very happy i think they do things the right way people i want to do business with i'm happy to be here and i don't really talk about it with many other players they have asked a couple of questions but i trust them,0
brooks koepka,1,2021-10,2021,267,1,0,1,distance has always been important on the pga tour from nicklaus to daly to woods to yourself and others but now with what bryson is doing seems like there's a new spotlight on it what's the first thing that comes to your mind with his embracing of the long drive philosophy and what potential impact and influence do you think this will have on the tour,i think it will be a big impact i think you kind of saw it maybe coming out of covid i think you saw even other guys trying to hit it further swing a little harder trying to maximize their distance i think it's going to change the game of golf forever personally but if you're going to hit it that far and you find a couple fairways it's tough to beat it does get very difficult when you got wedge into hole where guys got iron your odds are going to be in your favor that's what he's done it's impressive to be able to actually change a body change the way you swing and but yet still compete out here action i think that's probably the most impressive thing it's one thing to do it and then just kind of mess around with it at home but not bring it to an actual tournament so the fact he's able to do that the fact he did at the long drive i don't think anybody really thought he was going to get that far but the fact he did was quite impressive so i think and it's one of those things you're seeing all these younger guys they come out of college and i remember hearing about cameron champ from sean foley for probably about two years before he was out here and i think you're just going to continually see that type of distance come from the kids that are in college or high school now that will be out here in five six years,0
brooks koepka,1,2021-10,2021,225,1,0,1,i would think rest would help with your injury situation so i was curious what your philosophy is about playing these fall events and how many you plan to play and if you wish there was a longer off season,yeah i mean i always try to take my breaks i like playing if i can play play a couple weeks in a row usually my first week out isn't very good that's why i try to play as much as i can in between or right before a major my second third week out is usually the better of it and then at four it doesn't work for me i don't play that well in the fourth week so just trying to manage it and the fall schedule i'll play these two and then houston as well helping design that golf course so it's one of those things where i felt like i need reps so that was one of the things why i want to play i need more competitive golf because i felt like i don't know what i can't think of the results other than playing decent at the pga but i felt like i didn't play that well i know i had the injury but it was just it wasn't up to my expectations so kind of turning that corner now of all right i can starting to see some things especially at the ryder cup i thought that was a big thing for me and just stay healthy because then i can i don't have to worry about rest,0
brooks koepka,1,2021-10,2021,78,0,1,1,speaking of next week you're playing in a course nobody's really ever seen before what's your philosophy going into a tournament like that where it's a brand new venue,really doesn't matter i'm pretty sure there's been guys that have pitched up to i mean we did it all junior golf colleague amateur stuff you never played the golf course and go play so i personally don't think it's a big deal i think sometimes it's made a little bigger deal than what it is done it our whole lives or especially more when we were younger not so much when we're on tour but it's fine,0
brooks koepka,1,2021-10,2021,223,1,0,1,i know your little brother didn't make it through q school a couple weeks ago as someone who has played on the challenge tour and all these different levels and you've played a lot of golf with chase how small is the gap between the guys who are struggling to get there and the guys you're going to be playing against this week,there's a very minimal gap i played with guys outside my brother including even including my brother where you're trying to figure out how they're not out here just comes down to playing well at the right time it's more difficult to get out here than it is to stay out here i think once you get that actual i mean you got to play well one week a year q school and then you got to have a year on the korn ferry to get out here it's not like it was back in the day where you could have one good week and then you're out on the pga tour as far as my brother goes he was down there with us before the ryder cup and i watched him play he's plenty good enough to be out here just needs to put it together at the right time and kind of find his way i think he's doing a lot better job of that just from talking to him over the last couple weeks and i think he's really kind much i don't want to say found himself but he's doing i'm impressed with what i see i know it didn't work out for him but he's definitely going in the right direction and i'm proud of him for that,0
brooks koepka,1,2021-09,2021,47,0,1,1,what were your thoughts on what commissioner monahan said the other day,i mean i get it try to be as everybody's trying to be as respectful as you can between me the fans everybody try to live their life like that so i think we all can do a better job but at the same time it's fine,0
brooks koepka,1,2021-07,2021,84,1,0,1,how much do you enjoy coming to the uk i appreciate it's a very different year with covid but tell me about that and about the challenges of coming and playing links golf and taking part in an open,yeah disappointing pga i started off with a double made a mental mistake there so that drives me nuts i don't mind making mistakes making a bad swing but when you make a mental mistake i kind of pride myself on not making a mental mistake during a major and that was unfortunate at the end of the day i just didn't play good enough i didn't putt anywhere remotely good enough to win i didn't deserve it but still lost so doesn't matter,0
brooks koepka,1,2021-07,2021,69,1,0,1,i can't use in the circumstances the word pete cowan used to describe what you said about not getting the job done at the u s pga you were rather annoyed shall we say how would you sum up your feelings about not getting over the line in the last two majors,i only played the front nine i don't know it's not my favourite venue that we've played i think portrush and st andrews are definitely the favourites i haven't seen all i'll see the back nine today but a couple quite a few blind tee shots kind of hitting to nothing fairways are quite undulating i don't know it's not my favourite of the rotation put it that way,0
brooks koepka,1,2021-07,2021,108,1,0,1,what do you think of the golf course how does it compare to some of the other open venues and what do you think is its biggest challenge,yeah i think i probably haven't played my best over here i don't know i think over the last couple years i don't want to say it's been a distraction but i've won the pga or the u s open before and i've enjoyed those weeks after a little too much i came over sunday was the first time i touched a club since travelers maybe i always don't have the best of prep coming into this but i feel good i feel my game feels solid i like the way i'm hitting it right now and definitely more comfortable than i've been in years past coming over,0
brooks koepka,1,2021-06,2021,183,1,0,1,MODERATOR,yeah i just felt bad for my brother i don't think people really understand how hard it is to monday into a tour event i've said it multiple times i think if i went out and tried to monday into every pga tour event i might get two or three of them it's very difficult it's very demanding you play holes on monday and you got to come here and play on tuesday because you're not playing the pro am so not getting the best prep that you normally would i just felt bad for him he was playing so good too i watched him on monday and then we played nine holes together on tuesday so i just felt bad for him travelers was nice enough to give him a spot back since rickie and myself i guess kind of took him out of the course with the contact tracing and all that stuff it's nice to be back and good to have my brother here and hopefully he can put together a good week and somehow find his way into contention,0
brooks koepka,1,2021-06,2021,92,1,0,1,just wanted to ask you if you can talk us through a little bit last year when you had to pull out what that was like what your emotions were what that whole thing was like for you and then maybe contrast it with your feeling this year that things are much closer to normal,yeah i think the fans up here are so supportive i think it's one of the best atmospheres for a regular pga tour event we can play and you see that with everything that they've got going on it's fun to play in front of them this golf course it lends a lot of birdies so we can hear a lot of applause and kind of know what going on around the course they do like you said a great job and it's fun to play in front of them up here,0
brooks koepka,1,2021-06,2021,81,0,1,1,i'm just curious when the kiawah golf channel clip came out public were you annoyed that that took place was it amusing to you at all and how would you characterize kind of the fallout the perception of you and bryson,it doesn't matter to me i'm not too concerned it is what it is like i said last week i don't think i don't live with regret it got out not a big deal and as far as perception i'm not really too concerned i'm worried about what i've got to do and what i'm doing i'm not concerned about what other people think if i was concerned about what everybody else thought i'd have been in a world of pain,0
brooks koepka,1,2021-06,2021,96,0,1,1,maybe this is a sliver of the same question i apologize if it is but is this good for golf in some way that there's a conversation that's different from what normally is talked about in golf with you and bryson,i think it's good for the game it's bringing new eyeballs like i said last week you've got different it's pretty much been on every news channel pretty much everything you look at online it's got this in the headline or it's up there as a big news story to me that's growing the game you're putting it in front of eyeballs you're putting it in front of people the game of golf who probably don't normally look at golf don't play it might get them involved i don't know how it's not growing the game,0
brooks koepka,1,2021-06,2021,153,1,0,1,brooks you talked about your focus perhaps that was the same last month miss the cut at at t and wind up finishing second and really focused at the pga is that part of your preparation,i mean i don't try to miss a cut i don't know i just have a harder time focusing in regular pga tour events than i do majors majors i know i'm locked in from the moment i hit the first tee shot even walking from the first tee shot to the ball my head is still going on what i need to do out here i kind of lose focus for a little bit i've got to figure it out that's why i struggle i think in regular events it's the focus and the energy the excitement level just isn't there when it would be in a major it's different i thrive off that bigger stage that big moment where there's a bunch of fans and a tough golf course i love it i mean this golf course is tough enough it's firm it's blowing you know just needed to be better,0
brooks koepka,1,2021-06,2021,61,1,0,1,brooks first time we've seen you in tournament play since the pga championship what would you say you got out of these two rounds at congaree,just reps i'm playing really good i like the way i'm striking the ball i like the way i'm putting the ball too just seemed to be a little bit of speed control what i see the greens are speed wise it just doesn't match up i'm playing really good i like where i'm at i'll take it to next week,0
brooks koepka,1,2021-06,2021,40,1,0,1,assuming you have the weekend off we've seen you go through stretches like this where you played the week before a major you miss a cut and then you spend five six days elevating your game to be ready to compete what are you going to do over the next five six days to be ready for torrey,my game's in good shape i know my score doesn't reflect it i like where it's at i feel even better than where i was going into the pga i'm pretty pleased pretty happy just get ready for next week,0
brooks koepka,1,2021-06,2021,230,1,0,1,brooks you said your knee was feeling better from the pga what was the aftermath of that did you feel like they didn't handle things the right way at the end were you just kind of surprised at the whole surge of it and i guess you appreciated the apology the next day,yeah it was interesting when you're in the moment you're just trying to like from the middle or i guess from the semi i'm just thinking okay can i hole this out is there a way to hole this out or at least have a good look at birdie where he's got to be able to two putt that then before i even hit my second shot people were in front of me so we had to wait and stuff like that then once i hit the second shot everyone had already gone in front of us so we just had to walk through it i mean it wasn't a big deal it just would have been nice to have a little bit more i think we had one cop walking with us and it was kind of tough to get through other than that it was a pretty cool scene you saw it with tiger and rory at east lake things like that the only difference was it just would have been nice to be in front of the people but other than that it was pretty cool to be a part of and see and the atmosphere and the fans i mean we haven't had fans for what a year just over so it's nice to have the fans back and have their support and props to phil,0
brooks koepka,1,2021-06,2021,53,1,0,1,i'm guessing too that the way you played at the pga you're pretty excited about your chances at the u s open next week,yeah i'm playing good i like the way everything's been going my body's getting better and better every day feeling more comfortable doing things on the golf course that maybe i couldn't do from augusta to pga it's just getting better and better every day so i'm very pleased and like my chances,0
brooks koepka,1,2021-06,2021,208,1,1,1,i wanted to go back to the pga thing can you tell us what it was that bryson said or did in that moment that caused your reaction which was obviously pretty telling and secondly were you upset that that got out i mean obviously it doesn't appear it was meant to in the moment you had that and then later on are you not happy that it got out or are you okay with it at this point,it doesn't bother me honestly i'm okay with anything i do i don't really live with regrets it's nothing i'm terribly upset about from everybody i spoke to it is what it is and move on as far as that was he didn't say anything to me he wasn't speaking to me he was i guess either signing his scorecard or wherever he was and i was just to the right of the media tent or i guess right in front of the microphones where you guys all were and i don't want to say he was like screaming he was saying something about how he hit a perfect shot and it shouldn't have been there and it was just very very loud i don't think the mikes picked up on that but it felt like just so that the fans could hear with the media right there you kind of know hey look we're all kind of in this area just tone it down and it was just so loud then i think he realized that he had gotten right behind me and he toned it down a little bit but it was still and i just lost train of thought which i think was pretty obvious,0
brooks koepka,1,2021-06,2021,90,1,0,1,i'm just curious has the pga tour got in contact with you or your agent about this bryson feud back and forth by any chance,i have no idea i really haven't spoken to blake too much i've spoken to him a couple times but he was on vacation so i was trying to let him be he doesn't get too many vacations so i was just trying to let him be i speak with the tour all the time we speak maybe once a week once every other week just about what's going on out here how to better the tour the game players we speak all the time we're always in constant communication,0
brooks koepka,1,2021-04,2021,52,1,0,1,if it wasn't masters week would you have taken another week or two,i wouldn't have been playing for another month if it wasn't this week so i'll take a nice long break after this way i look at it i have two more days to do rehab that i probably wouldn't get if i was out here and i'll get ready for the pga,0
brooks koepka,1,2021-04,2021,47,1,0,1,will that be the next time the pga,it's tough to say right now that's what five weeks ahead i think it's kind of tough to say that i won't miss it i know that but tough to say if i'll play anything before that just for how it feels how rehab goes and everything,0
brooks koepka,1,2021-04,2021,100,1,0,1,having made it to this tournament do you feel like you have a plan you kind of know what to expect going into the pga since that's where you want to be,yeah i mean i'd like to practice a little bit more or be actually hitting balls before a tournament a lot of it was just making sure i could walk and things like that so the prep wasn't as good but it's nice to know that i can walk so at least that kind of is out of the way we can start kind of the strength which is two parts of the rehab process just one getting it to work and two kind of strengthening it so it's not as fatigued and just getting the mobility out of it,0
brooks koepka,1,2021-02,2021,54,0,1,1,so you had i guess months or so of being injured and then you had no fans the injury was worse but then the no fans was sort of adding insult to injury i suppose do you feel like now you're and you've got fans you're sort of back to being brooks koepka,deep down yeah i did i don't know it's what i live for i live for those moments where you got to close you got to hit some quality shots quality putts i don't know i just like showing off i guess those last few holes were it was nice to see that again,0
brooks koepka,1,2021-02,2021,61,1,0,1,you have such a focus around the majors how good does it feel to win a pga tour title again,it's a good feeling it's been so long to me yeah there has been a lot of days between but last year in my head i think part of that reset process and getting back to where i want to mentally physically and all that stuff was having to put last year or in my mind pretend like it never happened,0
brooks koepka,1,2021-02,2021,200,0,1,1,second thing was you mentioned it feels like a long time in golf terms hasn't been that long guys go through ups and downs did it feel like a comeback of sorts to you,i heard half the question i think i know where you're at butch i mean i think in my mind he's the best swing coach to ever live him and pete cowen the two best that old school that generation i've always admired them for being very blunt honest what makes them so good is they know exactly what to say at the right times how to motivate you get you going whether it be getting on you i've had pete yell at me before quite a few times i know at erin hills on tuesday i got a nice ass chewing from pete told me i would never win that's part of it too but what they see i don't know how their brain works but everything butch has said i saw him right before vegas and i have been texting with him constantly i couldn't have done it without them at the same time a lot of work that i've done with claude i can't throw claude out just forget about him a lot of this is what i've done with claude as well you know all three of those guys have basically changed my career i think,0
brooks koepka,1,2020-11,2020,98,1,0,1,MODERATOR,i mean it hurt physically that wasn't fun but i mean i put myself in contention over the last i don't know four years feels like pretty much every time even the pga tour it was right there on sunday try to get it done it was just body wouldn't let me do it it was nice to be back to normal and feeling good because i like the way i'm playing hitting it good putting it good and doing everything right and i guess just shows all the hard work for those two months that i missed,0
brooks koepka,1,2020-11,2020,154,0,1,1,MODERATOR,no it's not that i regret not taking time off the one thing i regret is not really doing the right things it was more i don't want to say i was slacking but i didn't put the effort i needed to to rehab and that's on me so i've got to live with that i didn'tâ€‘â€‘ i just thought there was a certain point you know i trained so hard done all that before the masters lastâ€‘â€‘ last year where i was like i'm just going to take some time off from the gym i've worked hard enough i want to you know take a few months then just became lazy simple i didn't work hard enough and kind of had to redevote myself to working out in the gym making sure that i'm getting better because that's the whole point of trying to get better you're not trying to stay the same,0
jon rahm,1,2024-02,2024,69,0,1,1,jon obviously this is just your second liv event but you guys are going to be in a marquee group tomorrow is this kind of what you thought it would be you guys are the best in the world in the final group in the final round,yeah it really doesn't make a difference i remember people telling me oh you have to start out hot the average score of the winner is under i'm like well three days shoot as low as you can that's about it last week i forgot we played three days until somebody mentioned it afterwards and if you hadn't said anything right now i completely would have forgotten as well,0
jon rahm,1,2024-02,2024,49,0,1,1,kieran there was one day last week where you out drove every single person in the field by yards did anyone out here know that you were the bomber out on tour before you got here and is that going to be your mark here at liv golf,i feel like it's up to him if he wants us to help he'll ask if not i don't think any of us are the type of people to just go up to him and tell him something because you never know if you're going to help or not,0
jon rahm,1,2024-02,2024,130,0,1,1,caleb how do you approach learning about being a pro golfer,i mean it's hard to say do i believe he deserves to be in majors yes does he have the talent to contend and possibly win majors yes but unfortunately the reality that he's going to have to try to qualify for two of them and i don't think he can play two of the other ones it's a little bit sad but it's hopefully something that we see a change in the future encouraging players in liv golf to be able to qualify or maybe a change in the world ranking whatever it may be because there's definitely a lot of players here that are more than capable to contend and win majors and are not going to have the chance in the near future i hope it changes,0
jon rahm,1,2024-02,2024,42,0,1,1,can you talk us through the process of when you decided to make this move to liv did you reach out to jon how did that whole process work,yes ideally to be the best in the world you have to beat the best in the world period not that there will be an asterisk but joaco not being there is definitely a step down in the level of the field,0
jon rahm,1,2024-02,2024,160,1,0,1,there's a lot of great history at this course greg norman won here in ' first million dollar purse in pga tour history what do you know about the history here and vegas in general,i'd like to think i know quite a bit about the history of the game but i know nothing about golf in vegas i'm sorry a lot of times we played here it was mainly as amateurs in college i don't know anything about it and there's been very few pro events we've had here i think the only times i've played you do have it at tpc summerlin i played the cj at shadow but most of my golf career here in vegas has been amateur actually so i'm not very familiar with it but i remember talking to tom pernice and he was the one telling me that these are some of the best greens they've all played on and how they all have really good memories i tried to talk to greg about it he didn't tell me he won here looking forward to learning a little bit about it because it's something i really find interesting,0
jon rahm,1,2024-02,2024,265,0,1,1,now that you've experienced liv what have you learned about liv or what's surprised you about liv coming here,well we experienced liv in cancún which is probably going to be very different to liv here in vegas and adelaide and so on i think the destination has an impact on the way it's going to be like the biggest thing for me going into it based on what the people were telling me is mainly the warmup and just the whole situation getting out to the tee but for the people that know and that at least friends of mine we have this men's game on fridays at silverleaf which is a shotgun around noon and last time we had people and it's basically a clusters of amateurs trying to warm up having drinks and just in and out of spots and going off and all of a sudden we all get in the carts we go to the tee and go off i can say i've had a bit of experience in shotgun starts in that sense but just with the best players in the world it was a little bit more organized that was the main concern for me i found it pretty honestly entertaining it's just funny how we warming up all at the same time and then two minutes later everybody is gone it's definitely different for people watching the atmosphere the music it's different but i think it's very entertaining it gives the crowd a level of engagement that i wasn't expecting everybody seemed really into the music and into the golf and it was really fun to play before a crowd that was enjoying it so much,0
jon rahm,1,2024-02,2024,135,1,1,1,jon and tyrrell you mentioned the possibility of playing dp world tour it sounded like even this year but if not in the future and certainly pga tour in the future what do you know that we don't because when you talk to the powers that be on those tours they have no interest in you guys coming back,i have hope that's all i can say on my part with dp world tour though we've seen examples of people playing events that's definitely a possibility i would love to if allowed and if i can go play the spanish open and if it doesn't conflict with liv's schedule right but a tournament that both me and tyrrell are going to miss dearly is wentworth if i qualify i'd still love to go play in dubai the dp world tour championship there's certainly events i would like to play pga tour we'll see if there's ever a way back and a way where we can play even if it's as an invite i will take it like i said there's certain events that are special to me that i would still love to support,0
jon rahm,1,2024-02,2024,150,0,1,1,we announced our technology partnership with google and pmy with our any shot any time new application that we're going to be launching tell us what that means to liv golf to have a partner like google,i mean it means if google sees the potential of liv golf i think it should be certainly eye opening for other people being able to basically go on the app and be able to see any shot any time it's not only great for the fans and the spectators out there i'm a golf fan as well and i'm somebody who usually goes back and tries to see it so i'll definitely be using it as well so selfishly for me it's fantastic i know my family back home you can't always be seeing the shots that you want but now they're going to be able to actually be watching the shots i hit i'm really happy to hear that this project is going to be launched and actually happen i think it's great for golf great for all of us and selfishly great for me and my family,0
jon rahm,1,2024-02,2024,173,0,1,1,you just mentioned obviously your team made moves up the leaderboard today what would it mean to get a team win on your debut weekend with liv compared to an individual win tomorrow,you know i think if any of that happens tomorrow you can ask me the same question and i'll give you a better answer than right now i can just give you a generic it would be amazing but if either of one or both happen i think i'll be better qualified to answer it but like i said i'm really proud of how the guys finished i know caleb had it going at one point struggled and then finished with a birdie on and i saw his putt on must have been really close from going in same with tyrrell is not playing easy and to close the round with a birdie was very clutch to pick up those spots i'm very proud of them and hopefully i can keep doing what i've been doing hitting the ball great and giving myself plenty of birdie chances i'm still going to need a low round tomorrow to catch joaquin he's clearly playing good golf and he's probably not going to make it easy,0
jon rahm,1,2024-02,2024,186,0,1,1,was there a time where you knew what niemann was doing when did you realize that,well i didn't look at a scoreboard i didn't see him early on and then when i was under and i was tied for fourth i was like somebody is i was under through and i was third so i was like okay clearly everybody is going off i think it was on when he was under it was okay it's impressive clearly birdies are out there but you have to play really good golf that he did it's impressive i could see under but i would confidently say that i would have bet a lot of money against a here this week just because of how narrow the fairways are you can make really good swings i can see a couple of really good swings that just didn't end up on the fairway and then it's a toss up in the rough i don't know what his stats were but well he must have hit fairways or made a lot of putts whatever it is it's a heck of a round what is it now liv golf events there's a and a it's pretty impressive,0
jon rahm,1,2024-01,2024,176,0,1,1,MODERATOR,well the weeks leading up to the announcement weren't the easiest i had to weigh a lot basically get enough info to then make an informed decision even through the process of negotiations it was just very very deep waters compared to what i'm used to i had to be more involved than i thought i was going to have to be but once the announcement was made i think everything became a lot easier having to keep the secrecy and not being able to talk to anybody about it was difficult again once it became public the reaction was pretty much what i expected the ones that are close friends that maybe had an idea or not have supported me and obviously there's some people that are going to disagree with any decision we make in life pretty much in line with what i expected but it was nice to have some time after that before my first competition round in liv golf to process and then actually kind of refocus and get to work,0
jon rahm,1,2024-01,2024,22,0,1,1,tyrrell obviously today is your very first day at liv golf so welcome i imagine it's been a bit of a whirlwind for you how are you feeling,oh my god none of you is going to mention a single team really you're going to leave it up to me,0
jon rahm,1,2024-01,2024,153,0,1,1,jon can you describe what the last couple of months have been like obviously it was quite the big move that you've made it got a lot of attention back in early december and just the time since whatever feedback you've gotten in making this move,yeah obviously we'd all like to think that we have the team to beat based on past performances there's been trades so a lot of times it's hard to see anybody has a chance any give week but obviously defending champions crushers both the league and here aces are always a strong team with talor gooch now on the team smash is always going to be two great players with him and brooks definitely a chance torque great last year as well i'd say those four teams so far are the quickest ones that come to me that obviously have been playing really good golf fireballs as well now with pooch in it played quite a bit of golf back home with him since we both live in arizona and he can easily take it deep on the golf course they definitely have the firepower as well i could name every single team,0
jon rahm,1,2024-01,2024,253,0,1,1,caleb the last few weeks have to be pretty crazy for you i'm curious what those have been like and what went into your decision to come out and join liv,i don't want to leave anything out basically especially after the ryder cup and being in rome the whole gladiator theme was really appealing to me gladiator warrior spirit was something that meant fight kind of a team fighting together and a couple names came up and at some point somebody said legion xiii that we were going to be the th team and me and my wife and a couple other people kind of looked at each other like it has a better ring than other things then when you get into the legion and what it means in itself i thought it was an empowering name and then basically two things as to why i found it so good there's a comic book i grew up reading as a kid surprising right it's named asterix and obelisk i don't know if anybody knows what it is but it's a town somewhere in europe that the romans couldn't conquer because they had a wizard that had a magic potion and the legion in charge of trying to conquer that town over and over again is legion xiii which was also a real legion that was always faithful to julius caesar both when he was i believe the consul for the republic and then as an emperor as well kind of helped him get back to rome and not take over but yeah kind of take over there was a lot of storylines throughout it and that's why we liked it so much,0
jon rahm,1,2024-01,2024,112,0,1,1,kieran you have a bit of an upper hand because you have played out on liv golf before and your brother has been playing here so you have some experience who do you think is the team to beat knowing what you know,being an athletic bilbao fan they're called the lions it's an unofficial there's not a logo but it's the unofficial team name i wanted to go down that route then this style of the lion and then the lettering is basically where i try to use my ancestry and my ties to the basque country where i'm from and they use a lot of the writing that you would see there to create the actual logo so yeah they did a really good job i'm happy with how it turned out we have a lot of options with and lions and different things but i'm happy with what we ended up with,0
jon rahm,1,2023-11,2023,32,1,0,1,if i could follow up because obviously we've woken up to the news this morning that rory mcilroy has resigned from the policy board on the pga tour just quite simply what's your reaction to that there's obviously a vacancy there now as well,i'm not sure that really matters if i was surprised or not did i expect it not really but again i can understand why somebody would do especially with everything that's involved,0
jon rahm,1,2023-11,2023,134,1,0,1,it's far ahead but next season is going to come soon and the olympics in france i wanted to know how high are the olympics in your goals are there and what is the memories that you have,hard to say hard to say being part of the pac and the chairman it does require some time i don't know i think it is a significant commitment so it could have an effect it's not only the meetings it's the phone calls and the players wanting to talk to you so those hours you spent on the golf course are a little bit busier so i think it could hinder a little bit and there's a reason probably why i can't recall any great player being a full time board member and winning tournaments and majors at the same time at least in recent history maybe there was maybe back one day on the pga tour but i can see how the lack of sleep definitely will limit your ability to compete,0
jon rahm,1,2023-10,2023,232,0,1,1,the scenes on the last few holes were you aware of the situation what were your emotions when your tee shot on hit the green and rickie conceded the putt,obviously i don't have as much experience in ryder cups as rosey and rory have but i think they mailed it it's the ability to walk through those gates and those doors and forget about who you are outside of this week what you have done or what you may do afterwards really truly doesn't matter in my case obviously the spaniards have a legacy to live up to it's certainly not easy right the three main figures before me seve ollie and sergio are three guys that if i'm not mistaken all three of them have earned points in the ryder cup three out of nine are spanish so it's a lot to live up to and it's something that really inspires me especially when josé is around right he always tells me little things to inspire me in that sense so following in their footsteps and how they try to make the team better is the way i've approached it as well i try to do my part in the team room but i think rory said it best is the fact that we can go in there and make fun of each other and nobody really cares right we all laugh and that's about it i mean you need to be able to make fun of yourself and it's a truly humbling experience to be part of this team,0
jon rahm,1,2023-09,2023,237,1,0,1,was it former winning teams or was it family stuff,it's weird because i don't know how much of a time off he had but because i had certain starts and i played the u s open there wasn't like any downtime i think we went from nationals to going back home and get ready because we're playing a u s open in a weird way it just seemed like almost the same and because i played a major before i went to my first pga tour event it almost felt like not a downsize but easier in that sense and i performed well enough in both it's weird to say what to get used to i think early on it's the travel and how much you do in college golf you travel saturday sunday is practise round you play monday and tuesday tuesday night you're at home some of those pga tour events you get there sunday night or monday and you're playing two practise rounds or one and the pro am and four days of tournament it's sort of why the same reason as to why kobe blamed those air balls against utah early in his career it's just not being conditioned for this many games in a row you almost have to get used to playing that much golf and that might not come into play for him a little bit later but that was definitely something that i had to learn early on,0
jon rahm,1,2023-09,2023,195,1,0,1,the vice captains with the division we've just seen in golf seems that we are past the worst of it going forward would you like to see some of those old guys the great players representing europe sergio i'm thinking of back in the fold as a vice captain would that be something that you would welcome is sergio someone that you would lean on ordinarily as a spaniard with the cultural connection,i think it would be really stupid of anybody not to lean on sergio garcía's experience in the ryder cup i mean he is the best player europe has ever had won the most points and has shown it time and time again if he were able to be a vice captain i absolutely would lean on him same as we are going to lean on ollie this coming ryder cup right when it comes to the game and all those players being able to be back it's been a difficult time obviously things have changed a little bit i wouldn't know how to answer because we are going to have to see if it's possible or not right i would like to see it but unfortunately we've seen some of those players give up their european tour status where that's no longer a possibility so i would like to see it but we don't know what the future holds right i think with this agreement or this possible union between the pga tour dp world and pip might change things a little bit so until then it's hard to really give you an answer,0
jon rahm,1,2023-08,2023,207,1,0,1,there were some guys who were pretty crest fallen and disappointed to not get here it looks from the outside looking in like the way things are structured now with getting into the designated events next year and whatnot that the new structure has sort of shined a brighter light on how competitive it is out there and how hard it is to be at the top of the pga tour i was just wondering if that feels like that being on the inside,i think from the outside without real experience and what we experience as players you're never going to get the full scoop on how difficult it really is to be out here and the more we can do to show the elite level of some players it's pretty special i'm pretty sure you can go down the stats of st to th in the fedexcup and consider they've had a pretty darned good year they're incredible golfers yet they can't make it to the end of the playoffs like it happens in many other sports but we carry what we've done all year around i'm glad it's showing how difficult it truly is because it is but i can tell you that it probably is more difficult and more challenging and more competitive than what you can probably see or imagine in all these players' heads just because it truly is it's an elite number of players that can call themselves pga tour players and the elite of that elite will be making it to this week and a more selective group to next week and even more selective to ryder cup even within the greats there's some little divisions of great players yeah it's extremely competitive,0
jon rahm,1,2023-08,2023,120,0,1,1,do you think there's going to be a huge appetite for it obviously the new schedule is going to come in and it's kind of replacing the winter swing but where do you think golf fans are going to fall on this or what do you hope for,i think so you're appealing to maybe a little bit of a different audience with the time of day we're playing the type of golf we're going to be playing like many sports nowadays i think that is going to allow for probably a lot more live gambling which is what a lot of people are trying to do nowadays when they're watching sports i think we can appeal to a different audience and i'm looking forward to that as well i've heard a lot of great reviews and thoughts from friends of mine looking into it before they knew i was invested in it and wanting to play i think we have the opportunity to do something very special,0
jon rahm,1,2023-08,2023,142,1,0,1,in general when you look as probably the preeminent guy who will bounce back between both tours how many events for you is too many events on the annual calendar year,it's hard to say it's hard to say i think it all depends on the scheduling and how those events are spaced out my fall the last few years has looked pretty much the same i go to wentworth spanish open dubai i wouldn't be able to tell you an exact number it really depends on the year i've been comfortable the last few years playing around events but i can tell you i'm one of those players that wishes we could have an actual off season and with the pga tour and the dp world tour coming together closer i'm hoping i get to a point where maybe october november december there's no events for me to play i can be home and be dad and earn an off season like basically almost every other athlete in this country can do,0
jon rahm,1,2023-08,2023,118,1,0,1,even though you have yet to play poorly probably for many decades by now but do you come into each year with any expectations and knowing that you still have to start over and earn it or i don't mean to flatter you here but as consistently well as you've played since you came out do you just come to expect it now,do i expect it yes and no i put in the work so i would expect positive results from it i know what i'm capable of what those results are i can't tell you i've had a good career so far and only once i've been able to get multiple pga tour wins this is the second year of being able to do it so hopefully i can keep adding to that and be able to get two or more in many seasons to come i like to add that to one of my labels of consistency throughout it but just having been able to win every single year for the last six years is quite an accomplishment,0
jon rahm,1,2023-08,2023,108,1,0,1,i think there's a players' meeting with jay tonight what are you hoping to hear from him as this continues to move forward,i have no idea i really have no idea i was told before we got a text that this was probably going to happen i'm probably going to go open minded and hearing the membership out that's kind of what i go i would like to see where other people's heads are at i don't know if there's going to be any announcements from the pga tour management side or not but i'll just go hoping i get to hear what other players have to say and see how different that is or same to what i'm thinking i really can't tell you much because i don't know,0
jon rahm,1,2023-08,2023,48,1,0,1,why did you decide to be a part of that letter,because i believe we have a duty as some of the players and the more unified front we present the better chance of getting what we want done will happen so yeah i believe it was a very good cause for the pga tour and for the players,0
jon rahm,1,2023-08,2023,261,0,1,1,could you talk about yesterday obviously had time at the hub to meet olivia and calvin and kind of participate in that what does it mean to be here with the patients and that activation how fun was that for you,i wish we could do more things like that throughout the year it was a lot of fun we're getting questions about golf politics and throughout the year we keep talking about liv golf and all of this and to get perspective and doing a really fun video activation with jordan spieth and calvin and olivia is very refreshing first thing calvin said when i met him first thing he said is i'm blessed to be here this and that i don't like the heat but i'm blessed that's all he kept saying he's an oakland boy and he didn't really enjoy the humidity that there is here in memphis but he was very happy to be there and same with olivia we were in one of the biggest hangars i had ever seen and somehow it didn't seem like it was enough room for her to run around and be herself it was extremely fun for people that get to see it at the end jordan and i got into it as well it was pretty fun to see us run around and kind of feed off their energy it puts things into perspective of what's important both of them are purple heart recipients i believe even within olivia's family her sister had some other health issues as well it really shows you what's important in life and how privileged i truly am to be in the situation i'm in it was a lot of fun and i hope i get asked to do something similar again in the future,0
jon rahm,1,2023-08,2023,167,1,0,1,for the big events the signature events each one gets four free spots basically,listen i voiced this when it came up i wasn't in favor of those tournaments having invites or exemptions however you want to call it everybody that's playing has earned it one way or another to get exemption you just don't want it to go to somebody who just for whatever reason they liked as a person who got his pga tour card through pga tour exemptions you want them to go to the right person i'm hoping those events realize the position they're in and give it to people that truly truly can do something out of it there is a way for players not into those events to somehow qualify into those events so i'm hoping they use some of those to people who were close and didn't quite make it players that have earned it throughout their play in the past just hope they use them in a way that it can be meaningful for somebody for the year or their career in golf,0
jon rahm,1,2023-08,2023,333,1,0,1,if you had the chance to ask one question or make one change what would that be,that's too vague of a question because we really have no idea what's coming we're not in these meetings they have until january to be in those negotiations i can tell you right now my priorities are a lot lower than what a lot of people would think if i have to if i go by request i know this is going to sound very stupid but as simple as having a freaking port a potty on every hole i know it sounds crazy but i can't choose when i have to go to the bathroom i've told the tour this many times as simple as that just simple little things better for the tour even though they do a phenomenal job throughout the year just making it more consistent those tpc events because the pga tour is more involved our food situation is unbelievable they have nutritionists that they've hired to work with and the options and the sources are incredible so i would like to see that more across the board at every single tour event i would like to see physio areas to be a little bit better even though the gym trailer is great it's still a trailer so when you have three people in it you're a little crowded so seeing better workout facilities as well those are kind of things that i hope come out throughout this whole thing i've mentioned many times making the tour better for the players and i mean that the very basic things they can do in tournaments to make them all as good as they can be is where i'd like to see some changes everything else can come out afterwards but i'm not so worried about purses and bonuses and those things i think giving us the best amenities possible is one of those things that should be a concern that's at least a lot of things i keep going to with them it's not usually what's in people's minds,0
jon rahm,1,2023-07,2023,249,1,0,1,with apologies i have two really really different questions so bear with me we haven't seen you in a couple months and jay monahan is back to work has your opinion of him changed in the last six months and if so how,my opinion of him well there's been obviously big changes for all of us first i would like to say i did get a text from him but i haven't been able to speak to him i hope whatever he had wasn't too serious and i hope him and his family are doing good and his health has gone back to normal i wouldn't say it's changed jay has behaved so professionally and so well with me and my family i've seen him stop to talk to my dad and my mom at a few tournaments now and he's been really good to my family in that sense he's a really good man that's all i can say now as it comes to what he's been doing for us and the pga tour i think he's done a fantastic job i would say it was unexpected what happened i think what the management of the pga tour the turn they took without us knowing was very unexpected but i still think he's been doing a great job and right now after that happened i only think it's fair to give them the right time to work things out i still think they have the best interest of the players at heart all we have right now it's a framework agreement it's an agreement to have an agreement we really don't have anything right now to be able to say or judge what they've done that's all i can say,0
jon rahm,1,2023-07,2023,186,1,1,1,you were pretty vocal in support of being on the pga tour when all this liv stuff started and you never wavered from that there's been discussion about the possibility of players being compensated for staying depending on how all this works out do you feel like you should be compensated,it's a tricky question so i understand the pga tour wanting to do something for those players who helped and stayed on the pga tour but at the same time and i'll be the first one to say i wasn't forced into anything it was my choice to stay do i think they absolutely should be and there must be a compensation no i just stayed because i think it's the best choice for myself and for the golf i want to play now with that said if they want to do it i'm not going to say no laughter we all had the chance to go to liv and take the money and we chose to stay at the pga tour for whatever reason we chose as i've said before i already make an amazing living doing what i do i'm extremely thankful and that all happened because of the platform the pga tour provided me as far as i'm concerned they've done enough for me and their focus should be on improving the pga tour and the game of golf for the future generations,0
jon rahm,1,2023-07,2023,147,1,0,1,would that include trying to improve the pga tour letting some of those guys back if they want to come back and play,see that's one of the things that the agreement needs to sort out from what i hear they don't really want to come back so i don't know i really wouldn't be able to tell you it's tricky right i can understand people on the pga tour not wanting those players back and i can also understand why some of them want to come back there's some great events that a lot of people probably want to go and play again some great golf courses as well i wouldn't be able to tell you i do believe that some punishment should be in order but i don't know what i'm not a politician that's not my job that's for the disciplinary board and other people that are paid to do that my job is to hit the golf ball and try to do the best i can,0
jon rahm,1,2023-07,2023,103,1,0,1,how involved are you interested in being in all of those discussions going forward,i'll tell you the same thing i told the people on the pga tour if you want my opinion ask me if not i'm not going to go out there and impose what i think on you guys that's what i said i think they should talk to the membership and get an idea of where the players are at but it's not about just myself obviously it should be a general feeling of what the partnership wants to do i'm not going to be calling every single day telling them what i think and what should be done let's just say that,0
jon rahm,1,2023-07,2023,59,0,1,1,since you delivered that message have they reached out to you to,yeah they have when they need to know where our heads are at they've reached out they've called me and i've given them my opinion they've been fairly open on that they've hired some people on tour to come to tournaments and they're kind of in between us and some of the higher management yeah there's been communication yes,0
jon rahm,1,2023-06,2023,125,1,0,1,how long did it take you to understand or get into that and when you started as a professional on the pga tour looking back ' how different is the way you would prepare now compared with what you did then,laughter before all that i already had a break after this week in my schedule just because i feel like it's important to have that time off during the season and earlier on i chose to play certain events or just didn't have the opportunity to do it yeah even before all of that happened yeah i think it's something i had on my schedule i'm looking forward to it not because i need a mental break per se but because i do need a bit of rest to then be able to attack the rest of the season we still have plenty of golf to go starting at the open championship so what's happened doesn't make that much of a difference in that sense,0
jon rahm,1,2023-06,2023,149,1,0,1,last seven or eight months you've been on this great roll a lot of high finishes a lot of wins anything that you point to that's clicked in that's allowed you to keep it going and would you say your game is at the same level as it was when you won the masters,well i'd like to think so my belief in myself is the same i haven't played my best golf the last two starts actually i played really good at memorial just couldn't make the putts i needed to to keep the rounds going but i still think i finished th in a really tough setup hit it really really well obviously pga was a tough one yeah my confidence level is very high you have to have that belief in yourself as a competitor no matter what happens you stick to the process that's basically what i think has happened this year haven't really changed there's no magic formula i've just stuck to working on the things that i have to work on and when you do the little things properly eventually scores come and that's what happened to me this year late last year and early this year,0
jon rahm,1,2023-06,2023,112,1,0,1,do you think they should stick with the schedule as all this other stuff is going on,i mean they've got a part of it so as long as they don't one day wake up and change it earlier which i don't think the club manufacturers would be happy about yeah they can do whatever they want i just wish they really would take the pga tour players' thought and advice into consideration because one of the bigger benefits of golf is the fact that all amateurs and all professionals play under the exact same rules and if you start changing that it can be a slippery slope again if that's what they think is going to be best for the game it could be i don't really know,0
jon rahm,1,2023-06,2023,319,1,1,1,all the uncertainty being in the state of limbo as you described how do you not allow that to affect your game how do you stay focused on it you said you turned off your phone when you first heard for a couple hours but what else do you do just to focus on your game particularly this week,what i do to be honest i think a little bit in my case is perspective no matter what happens whether i agree with it or not thanks to the pga tour they give me a platform to play golf at the highest level and after taking advantage of that possibility i'm in a situation where my family and my kids don't have to struggle financially ever and i don't know how many generations i can help if i do it properly i'm in a very high state of privilege in this world i can do what i want i can do what i love for a living i have a blast every single day even though i get mad on the golf course every once in a while when i start with that point of view no matter what happens i can only be thankful to what's going on if things change things change i'm just i'll have to adapt to the situation and will have to make some decisions on what's going on forward and i'll make some decisions at the end of the day i'm still very privileged whether the pga tour liv golf align or not or who plays and who likes who it doesn't really matter i'm happy where i am in my life and every day in the morning when i look at my kids i'm even more blessed in that sense it's an easy way to forget about what's going on when i look at it that way i can see where i came from in spain especially every time i see my parents i remember where which came from and where i'm at to be honest all those possible issues seem like a very very small issue compared to other things in the world yeah i just consider myself very privileged and if anything very thankful to be where i am,0
jon rahm,1,2023-06,2023,104,1,0,1,do you think the agreement that's been announced in the golf world gives hope to your desire that the best players from europe would be able to represent the ryder cup team regardless of pga tour dp tour,i have no idea i have no idea again we have no clue the only thing i can say at this point is i have faith in luke donald and i have faith that luke is going to do the best and he's going to try to make the best decision for team europe and that's all i can do at the end of the day he's the captain and i'm not it's his ship to steer i have faith in my captain and i'm hoping not hoping i'm sure we're going to end up with the best team we can end up with,0
jon rahm,1,2023-05,2023,139,0,1,1,who is the jack nicklaus you know as you've gotten to know him a little bit how would you describe him beyond just great golfer,i mean i never got to know him as a golfer or watch him play live when he was active so i can't really tell you that side of him i know jack the let's say more entrepreneur side of jack and the golf course designer and the host of this event he's somebody who cares passionately about golf i think a lot of players from that era were extremely passionate and still are and you can see it he still obviously has his opinions about the game nowadays and the rules that we have nowadays which is perfectly fine and that somebody of his caliber he can voice 'em i think it's good for the game so it's somebody who truly loves and respects the game and something i respect about him because i resonate myself in that,0
jon rahm,1,2023-05,2023,217,1,0,1,or any of them should there be cuts on designated events,i've gone back and forth on this issue i had first was an advocate for no cut and the more time has gone by i've become an advocate for a cut so i think it's a part of the game and i think it's an important part of the game as harsh as it may be to cut out maybe only players at the flip side you know it's only players that you have to beat to make the cut so i think it's a part of it you earn your way into the weekend and then you earn that win it's a part i enjoy and i experienced recently at the pga i mean that friday had a different feel when i was fighting to make the cut it's a different type of pressure and you never know what playing good on a friday to make the cut might ignite towards the weekend so i think it's a part of it it's a part of the history if that went away tiger making something cuts in a row wouldn't have the same significance because that would never be broken again so like i said i pushed for the no cut and then as time has gone by i actually i think we should have a cut,0
jon rahm,1,2023-05,2023,166,0,1,1,reason i asked is you guys have had this schedule of a lot of designated events that you needed to play in and so forth wondering how it's wearing on you and phil mickelson proffered the notion that liv golf benefits from not playing as much and there for maybe fresher for majors what have you,well listen phil is a friend of mine but what else is he going to say right he's obviously going to advocate for his side and that's perfectly fine i mean listen there's many ways to prepare for a tournament and my schedule has not changed really like i played events last year from tour championship to sorry tournament of champions to tour championship and it will be the same this year it's been the same pretty much every year so it doesn't change my schedule it's just what tournaments i have played that's it i don't really feel any different about it i have heard those comments and well if he believes it to be true it's good for him i don't know it's hard to say there's been so many different ways of tackling major tournament golf phil himself used to always play the week before tiger and jack didn't play the week before so who says one way is better than the other,0
jon rahm,1,2023-05,2023,183,0,1,1,last week sergio said that he clearly will not be on the ryder cup team luke had told him he wouldn't be he specifically mentioned the fact that he would be missing playing with you and just was disappointed by that what's your thoughts about sergio not being on the team,i'm going to miss him we had a great partnership at whistling straights i'm going to mention history again one more time a spanish duo in the ryder cup i think to me is embedded into the roots of the ryder cup look with seve and ollie were able to do throughout their partnership right so it's a little sad to me that politics have gotten in the way of such a beautiful event again it's the best europeans against the best american period and whatever is going on who is playing liv and who is not playing liv to me shouldn't matter it's whoever is best suited to represent the european side and i have a hard time to believe that the best player europe has ever had the most successful player europe has had on the ryder cup isn't fit to be on the team so it's unfortunate i will miss him but with that said i want to be hopeful there's a couple of spanish guys playing really good right now so hopefully they can join me on the team,0
jon rahm,1,2023-05,2023,183,1,1,1,i wanted to go back to the rivalry for a second and one aspect instead of looking forward if you went back a year and a half ago and i think there was a lot of voices saying competition will make us better and you might have been of that same thought a year later is this about what you thought it would be,you mean with liv and all that sorry i missed that part i think we're in the stages of making it better they obviously i think it was easier for them you're coming out with a new product and it's exciting and it's a little bit easier to feel good about it early on than for the pga tour to change their product that's been on the market for years so it's easier for them to get those changes going and to adapt than it is for a tour that has some events so we're slowly making that transition into what we think is going to be a better tour i don't think we have seen the final product yet and it might be a few years until we see i don't think it will ever be a final product actually there's always adjustments when the fedexcup first came the playoffs had certain points it was four events quickly they reduced the amount of points and then we went to three events so it's always it's an ongoing change to make it better,0
jon rahm,1,2023-05,2023,50,1,0,1,do you think where we are right now and it was brought up already we got a million event we got another one at travelers and is this what you would have expected let's say january of a year ago,i don't know if it's exactly what i would have expected i wouldn't have been able to tell you what i thought was best for the tour mainly because i'm not knowledgeable enough of what goes on on every aspect of the pga tour but i think it's better yes,0
jon rahm,1,2023-05,2023,201,1,0,1,MODERATOR,well i hadn't played it before so i didn't know what to expect obviously i saw the pga some back highlights and obviously knew it was a challenging golf course but you can tell with this redo they wanted to make it a little extra difficult obviously it comes as no surprise i get a very similar vibe and feel around the golf course that you could get at bethpage or winged foot since we're so close to both those courses tough course whoever is setting up the golf course is going to have a lot of fun because there's a lot of opportunities on holes with pin locations and tee boxes so you can make this golf course as difficult as you want or not as accessible as you want but obviously you can make a big difference in the scoring i would say whoever did the redo has done a good job it's challenging but it's one of those where if you hit the shots you're supposed to hit put it in the fairway go to the center of the green nothing crazy should be happening but it's still challenging i like it fun golf course difficult but fun,0
jon rahm,1,2023-05,2023,6,0,1,1,i think there was great curiosity with the press and the public and probably some of the players about how the liv players coming into a major how that was going to go how much do you think looking back the masters has helped if it has kind of returned to some normalcy i guess of just coexisting,i'm the wrong player to ask,0
jon rahm,1,2023-05,2023,152,0,1,1,but you're the only one standing there,but i didn't really care in that sense i never got into the feud i've never had any negative feelings towards any player that went over to liv in fact i've mentioned many times i still play with many of them and still try to figure out try to play practice rounds with phil played with talor gooch yesterday really doesn't make a difference to me that's why my point of view nothing changed i think i said it at the masters where i hadn't realized how long i think the first person i saw was dustin from liv and i didn't realize how long it had been until i looked down and i saw him wearing footjoys and i was like okay this doesn't add up and then i realized i haven't seen you since the open last year that was my first moment again to me it's like nothing changed,0
jon rahm,1,2023-05,2023,96,0,1,1,another liv question we're a couple weeks away from the one year anniversary of them launching if you have to look into the future where do you see professional golf,i have no idea i wouldn't be able to tell you it all depends who you talk to if you talk to a liv player this is going to be great it's only going to get better you talk to people on the other side in two years they're going to be done i really couldn't tell you i have no clue i really have no clue i really don't know what to say obviously they're trying their hardest to be a little bit different and it could pay off or not i really don't know,0
jon rahm,1,2023-04,2023,149,1,0,1,you cap off two crazy weeks for you on the pga tour i'm sure you're ready to put the clubs away a little bit as you think about this past week what are your takeaways,you know i can't help but be proud of what i've done this week to come here i know the expectations weren't really high to the public but in my mind every time i tee it up i'm going to try to do my best after a shaky first round to play as good as i have i played really good on the weekend i just didn't make the putts and give myself a chance to even get close to the top it's great i didn't really know what to expect exactly out of myself and how i was going to feel mentally and physically so i'm proud of the way i pulled through i'm incredibly proud of finishing with a bogey free sunday on a very difficult golf course with that birdie on it's all smiles for me today and i'm going to go enjoy my afternoon off,0
jon rahm,1,2023-04,2023,148,0,1,1,the putt at the first hole you might have got the worst and probably the tougher side of the draw you were getting rained on and you were behind for a lot of the holes did you have a sense of calm throughout the week or how did you keep your composure,i don't know maybe it's a little bit related to determination you know i'm out there when i'm out there i have a job to do and it's to hopefully be here answering to this question right so i put i know we all do but we put in a lot of effort to try to beat the best guys in the world so maybe that level of intensity and that determination is what you see and that's why i'm characterized as a fighter i'm also never going to give up right even if i shoot myself out of contention whatever and i can finishing strong to give myself a possibility to finish fourth it's always going to be better than anything right so i wouldn't be able to live with myself if i didn't try my hardest on every shot so maybe that's where it comes from,0
jon rahm,1,2023-04,2023,178,1,0,1,you've had remarkable success on the pga tour so far this year but as a test of golf how different is this than what you see week in and week out on the pga tour and as a result does it make how you were playing before maybe not as indicative as it would be for another major,i mean you can always the form you aren't going to always be indicative on how good of chances you have but at the end of the day it's a new week right what you've done before doesn't really matter period there's been many times where there's players that haven't had the best year but for some reason they feel confident on their chances and they've done good golf some of the lefties come to mind and come out here and have good performances obviously tiger every time he came out here seemed like he had a good chance jordan no matter what he's up on the radar something about this golf course i think it's because it allows you to play however you want to play it that always gives every player a chance right there's multiple options off the tee multiple options into greens there's not one style of golf you can pretty much do it however is most comfortable for you and if you play good golf you might be able to get it done,0
jon rahm,1,2023-04,2023,144,1,0,1,if you go back to last year's jp mcmanus pro am how important was that week for the top players to come together and hash out ideas and come up with a vision to help reshape the vision of the pga tour,i think it was important with what was going on in the world of golf to basically show unity to ourselves right to show some sense of vision for the pga tour as players ourselves i think that was important not only for the tour itself but just for us players to see that okay where is everybody else and where do we want the shift to be going to that was the beginning of obviously a long process i think i'm glad we did it and it was needed right i don't remember the last time that let's say the top players of the pga tour got together to discuss the future i think it was something that was really good for all of us hopefully hopefully in the future we don't have to keep doing this because things are going so well,0
jon rahm,1,2023-04,2023,112,0,1,1,this week having the liv guys here and it seems like everybody is getting along really nicely does it change the dynamic does it make you miss them what have your emotions been hanging around the guys this week,nothing changes really i don't think they feel any different i don't feel any differently with having them to be honest i saw dustin first yesterday and sergio i kind of forgot honestly it didn't even dawn on me until i looked out and i saw dustin wearing footjoys i was like oh yeah things are different i kind of forgot right i had not seen him since the open championship but it didn't really register in my mind with dustin i feel like i've spent more time playing with him and against him than this new dynamic we have i feel like it changed at all at least in my mind,0
jon rahm,1,2023-03,2023,181,1,0,1,he thinks it will be a good thing and it will reward creative players and will return the integrity of the sport,i think it sets manufacturers back quite a bit i don't think it's fair to tell all these brands to have to go through the research the development and the testing of a brand new golf ball just for a few of us you're making them spend millions today putting them through the usga testing to maybe fail and have to go through all that i just don't think the pga tour and the manufacturers are going to put up with that i have a hard time believing it but it's happened before they have changed the grooves they keep having figuring out limitations for our game but either way whatever happens we'll deal with it i don't think like i said i think the usga could be investing their time in how to improve the game of golf in a lower level how to get more amateurs and more junior players to play not on trying to make it more difficult for us when course setup is all they need to do for golf to be hard enough for us,0
jon rahm,1,2023-03,2023,146,1,0,1,rory also said that if the pga tour didn't adopt the rule just chose not to play inaudible that he might play with a shorter ball anyway just because it would prepare him better for the majors could you ever see yourself doing that,let's see if the majors decide to do it i find it hard to believe as well that the majors would go completely against what the professional tours decide to do and if that were the case if that were to happen that would set a huge divide in the game of golf that is just not good for anybody so whatever they choose hopefully it's unanimous and then we'll deal with it whether it's a change or not again i think rory to an extent is right the change benefits the better player especially the longer players we kind of talked about it and i think i would be hitting it to yards shorter which would put me on what i was doing in and my golf game was pretty good back then as well so i don't think it would be a big difference,0
jon rahm,1,2023-03,2023,89,1,0,1,MODERATOR,it's always great to be back here it's a great week great venue the pga tour goes above and beyond for us to have as enjoyable a week as possible then the golf course which is always a test i love courses we go to where nobody has been able to assert a dominance right i think that speaks a lot to the design and speaks to the fact that the best player wins one of those weeks where you've just got to show up and be the best,0
jon rahm,1,2023-03,2023,144,1,0,1,could you talk a little bit about how much a golfer's personal life also helps in that maturity process whether it's getting married becoming a father because other players have always talked about that as well,smiling i mean yes and no i feel like as defending champion you've earned a right but we're talking about a very unique circumstance in the world of golf right i've always thought on those selective events that you need to qualify cj cup for example if you were to win you should automatically be into next year's cj cup to defend the tournament that's my belief that defending champions should always be there we're talking about different circumstances right now some players made a choice of going to a different golf league knowing that they weren't going to be allowed to play here and yes this is a massive event it is very close to major quality event but it's still a pga tour event so with that regard no like he's i don't think just him should be allowed to be here,0
jon rahm,1,2023-03,2023,124,0,1,1,a quick follow up how would you distinguish the three hole closing stretch in terms of difficulty and excitement this week and last,the first thing that pops to mind is the old trophy because i still have the old crystal memory right to me that's still the players championship trophy for some reason i don't know why but i get highlights of things that have happened in the past out here obviously famous one tiger making that putt on a couple of highlights of winners obviously adam hitting two in the water on and winning a couple that i've lived myself rory's drive on just memories and shots that i've seen over the years jason day's iron on as well and how difficult the greens were that year there's many different things that come to mind nothing really special except the old trophy for some reason,0
jon rahm,1,2023-03,2023,117,1,0,1,how would you characterize the player meeting this morning and just in general the feeling around the changes,i think actually i can't answer that because i haven't spoken to a large majority of the membership i haven't had anybody coming to me disappointed about the changes right i think other people are getting that side of things but a lot of people don't like change at first i can see the logic in what they are disapproving of but i think in the long run once you take a step back and you realize it truly is the best for everybody it's the best product for the pga tour i think they will understand but i really i really can't say much on the matter because nobody has come to me asking my opinion,0
jon rahm,1,2023-03,2023,136,1,0,1,what would you say is the right number of pga tour events for you given family and wanting to go play some in europe,if you're not happy with the product they're free to do as they choose i wouldn't know what to say i still think that the pga tour gives the best is the best platform for professional golfers obviously they're very different products and they differ in a lot of things but it's not the same so it could happen but like i've said before i'm not one to tell people what to do with their life and with their career i do think the changes that are happening are very positive very very positive it's only going to make it so you know the better players in the world play together more often which at the end of the day is what the fans want to see so i wouldn't know how to answer that exactly,0
jon rahm,1,2023-03,2023,100,1,1,1,i was just wondering in terms of some of the policies and the policy changes that are happening right now on the pga tour and there have been a lot of changes since the litigation began with liv golf i'm wondering if and then there has been some discussion about this among golf watchers about how some of the changes might potentially push some of the pga tour players to maybe considering moving to liv so i was just wondering even with the designated events with no cuts policies like that if folks are unhappy do you think they would be emboldened to look at other options like liv golf,oh it's liv golf i mean without a doubt without liv golf this wouldn't have happened so to an extent like i've said before we should be thankful this threat has made the pga tour want to change things i think i said it last week as well i wish it didn't come to the pga tour being you know under fire from somebody else to make those changes and make things better for the players but i guess it is what we needed so yeah it is because of liv golf otherwise we wouldn't have seen any of this,0
jon rahm,1,2023-03,2023,200,1,0,1,what do you think is actually causing the pga right now to look inward and to make all of these changes is there some sort of factor or moment in time that is sort of creating that,i mean we are the tour but i have no clue what any of the contracts or the tournaments and tv contracts or any of that says means or could entail right so i can't go as a player to a meeting with the pga tour and i say i demand all those things by tomorrow because it may not be possible that's exactly what i mean it's easier to sell it was easier this year to sell all these tournaments to put up more money and make those events the designated events guaranteeing that all those golfers were going to be in every single one of those events except one that's what i mean that there needs to be certain give and take if you're asking every single player on tour what they want and try to implement it god knows what would happen so that's kind of what i mean as players there needs to be an understanding that not everything we want is possible and maybe for all those things to happen we need to give up a couple things that maybe are not as important as we think they are for us that's what i mean,0
jon rahm,1,2023-03,2023,210,1,0,1,you had said earlier that there needs to be a give and take between the players and the tour why is it that you don't feel like you're the tour,that's a tricky question because i don't know when phil said that obviously there's been some of us that have had more knowledge of certain things than the rest of the tour do i think that's right not necessarily no but it's happened way too many times where you if you let information run out that shouldn't get to the media it always gets to the media then the problem is maybe that information is important to some tournaments and i wouldn't want to be a tournament director or a sponsor finding this out through somebody else that isn't either jay monahan or somebody on the pga tour so that's the reason for some of this communication being a little bit different but i do agree a little bit with that stance yeah i think in general a lot of times it could be a little bit more clear with why things are done or when things are done but i think that's what this player meeting was all about just letting the membership know again like i just said it's tricky because you can't just make everybody aware of everything at all times because it always get out and you don't necessarily want that private information to get out,0
jon rahm,1,2023-02,2023,84,1,0,1,and then how many players would you guess feel the same way you do,i have no idea i don't know the thing is you don't need to be firing on all cylinders to win i actually had a conversation similar to this with tiger i asked him out of the wins on the pga tour i didn't get into the other ones how many times do you think you played your best all four days and he said three at most right a lot of those sundays he played his best but the whole week very few,0
jon rahm,1,2023-02,2023,128,0,1,1,knowing your history here from arizona state to living here safe to say this one might mean a little more than some other ones out there,i mean every win's pretty good i'm not going to lie i would love to be able to do what i did in spain i was spanish amateur champion won a couple different ages being able to kind of close that chapter of pro and amateur career by winning the spanish open as a pro was very sweet so as the asu thunderbird champion i would love to be able to win here again in what's now home to me and my family i don't know if it would be added or not i think because of the crowd and being home it will feel obviously extremely nice but it will probably be very similar to what i've experienced in spain so hopefully i can get it done,0
jon rahm,1,2023-02,2023,121,1,0,1,it feels like even before this tournament became designated or elevated with now unique it is it's emerged as one of the premier tournaments on the pga tour i'm wondering among players where does this tournament rank among ones that you want to pick off before you're done,i think this was a designated event before we ever knew what they were going to be no matter what the purse is this tournament is going to be what it is very few sporting events in the world can comfortably happen in the same week as the super bowl and still have the impact that they have like this one with that said i don't think it's everybody's favorite i think either you love it or hate it there's no in between with my case i love it i want to come every year it ranks highly in my list but i know a few people that put it far down their list so i don't know what to say,0
jon rahm,1,2023-02,2023,141,0,1,1,you had mentioned this being a home tournament and i'm curious if you have any normal specific day to day routine that you're excited you get to enjoy this week while teeing it up,sleeping in my own bed big plus it's just waking up at home and knowing that you're home there's something relaxing about it morning and nighttime routine with the kids hotels sometimes you're not always in the same room or it can be a little bit more hectic they're comfortable with it it's very easy in that sense there's little things knowing that there's certain restaurants i can go to and know i'm going to be taken care of being a silverleaf ambassador and living at silverleaf knowing i can go to the club and have a relaxed afternoon if i need to i feel like i have a few more ways a few more outlets to kind of r r if i need to throughout the week more than a regular tour event where i don't know the city well,0
jon rahm,1,2023-02,2023,132,0,1,1,seems to be for you,no no it's not easy frustrating no but it is something that i want obviously i would never call it frustrating in a sport where you lose more than you win even at your best capacity it hasn't been frustrating i just obviously really want to be a part of it because i live here and i would love to win this tournament it's something special i was able to do it in spain and haven't been able to do it here so i want to show up for myself and for the people that are here supporting me but i wouldn't say it's frustrating it's not easy this course gets difficult when it gets firm and fast i know people still post scores but you have to play really good golf,0
jon rahm,1,2023-02,2023,235,1,0,1,we know your focus obviously is on the tournament starting thursday but how special is it for you to take part in events such as the dream day clinic like you did earlier today get more involved with the community and spread the message of positivity and getting involved in the game of golf and stuff like that,i'm ashamed to say that i didn't know that clinic was happening has been happening for years to be honest i wish i would have known earlier because doing clinics in tournaments is something i've mentioned to the pga tour that i will do more often because i think it's really fun for me and it's great to engage with the younger audience very often i hope i'll say it right here i hope if we keep having this designated events or as max capacity as possible i think there should be one every single week and have one of us big players do it it was one hour of my time in a morning where i just made the day of kids by being there not only myself but in a week like this we had larry fitzgerald and a pitcher for the diamondbacks over there as well you have three athletes from the valley that they get to show obviously they're not in their element but they're still there i wish this was something we did more often i would love to see it next week in la you could do something doesn't always have to be on site but in big tournaments like this i think you could do it more often because i would love to do it it's something i have no problem doing clinics are a lot of fun,0
jon rahm,1,2023-01,2023,128,1,0,1,that's kind of the next question which is you were playing well you were hitting the ball well you were putting the ball well and yet you're tied,he is yeah but make no mistake what you see and what he feels could be completely different things we're all nervous out there you feel it it's just how you deal with it first time in this situation teeing off with the lead on sunday in a pga tour event i think he did a great job he played good golf it was just i would say two bad swings at the wrong time and that was and one could say it was two holes where he was maybe trying to hit it a little bit hard trying to get some extra distance one cost him at least one shot and the one on cost him half a shot and that was the difference at the end,0
jon rahm,1,2023-01,2023,176,1,0,1,in terms of your kind of season and the last few months winning four of your last five worldwide starts how would you contextualize your comfort level on the course this stretch and where it relates kind of in your career,no i think that's it having played college for arizona state we played a very large amount of our tournaments arizona california southern california especially for some reason i'm just comfortable palm springs i mean might as well be scottsdale it's pretty much the same thing so golf is very similar but i wouldn't know why i think it's because i grew up on poa annua greens southern california i feel really comfortable on it's something that feels really familiar i think it's probably because the success i had in college was followed and kind of led into the pga tour and i won in my first few events in california right honestly if we start counting from until now my percentage i don't know what it is exactly we know about torrey pines but everything else i it was probably because i'm just so comfortable the life style suits me my wife and i love this part of the country she's happy i'm happy our kids are happy it's a lot easier to play golf,0
jon rahm,1,2023-01,2023,10,1,0,1,you talk about how the margins are pretty thin out here you seem to be making the margins a little larger four wins in your last six tournaments despite what some computers might say you seem to be the best player in the world right now do you feel like you can just maintain this or how much better can you get,are you counting his five majors as pga tour wins,0
jon rahm,1,2023-01,2023,216,1,0,1,no microphone,yeah well slight asterisk next to that one right laughing i mean seve didn't play full time pga tour so the fact that he had nine wins is pretty spectacular you know i've been fortunate to tie a lot of things he's done and if i ever get to surpass some of those things it would be incredible i've spoken many times the reason why i play golf not like motivation meaning my dad started playing golf because of the ' ryder cup and seve's captaincy that's basically why i'm here i asked my dad recently if your friends hadn't been down there to see that what would we be doing who knows i have no idea that's why i take representing golf in spain so seriously and why seve's legacy is so important to me when he started playing golf i think there were people with a golf license in spain at the time he died it was over so when i started playing i think it was three hundred something thousand so i would love to be able to escalate that i know it will be hard to do to the level that he did but if i can increase that number and make golf more popular in spain i'll be a happy man,0
jon rahm,1,2023-01,2023,189,1,0,1,we just ran a graphic on our show that this being your ninth pga tour win you tie seve for nine pga tour wins from the country of spain i know how much you look up to seve just sort of your reaction to that,it's too early to be asking me right there now the fact that we're teeing off in basically what hours it's another factor than if i have time to reflect on that but obviously like i've said i feel really healthy and i feel really comfortable in my swing so i'm going to go to torrey a place that i'm already very confident at with very high hopes knowing that i'm doing all the right things if i can keep hitting it off the tee and my iron game keeps staying at this level i'm going to have a really good chance at that golf course so i can't help to smile because again it's a very very emotional week every time i go in a very good way it's a very special place in my heart so going very confident and very willing to tee off very eager it's a very fun week it's one of the best courses we play all year you really have to tough it out out there and be the best so i'm looking forward to have a chance to do that again,0
jon rahm,1,2023-01,2023,134,1,0,1,i think you're one shot lower this year than you were in when you won here i'm not sure that means all that much in this tournament though especially given that you got two rounds at stadium,i think i'm tied i believe i believe i'm tied but again really doesn't matter what i did in the past stadium i remember that year played a little bit more difficult i think i shot even or under on that third round and barely lost any ground pretty sure if i do that tomorrow i will lose some ground so just got to keep on going at this point where we're at on the pga tour with so many great players going on you need to show up on the weekend and shoot low if anything is proof of it it's the fact that two weeks ago i shot under on the weekend and ended up winning the tournament so you have to keep the foot on the gas and keep making birdies,0
jon rahm,1,2023-01,2023,361,1,0,1,MODERATOR,yeah i'm thinking that last year's comments might come bite me in the ass although it was more venting off on the golf course i think for me it's obviously a great event and it's got a lot of history with arnie's legacy here as well i've loved it every time i've come here despite what i said on the golf course last year that's just a player letting out some frustration it's also a great way to get back into golf after maui meaning you are playing a golf course with a lot of uneven lies a lot of crosswinds it's very unusual golf to be playing in it's very easy to compensate to basically make the best of the shot with the wind you're playing very slow grainy greens it can take some time to adjust to maybe let's say pga tour golf on a regular basis on the main lands so i think this is perfect week to kind of get some competition rounds in more normal circumstances usually the weather's beautiful here you might get more or less wind on some days but the golf courses are usually in absolute perfect condition so you can basically make sure all your new equipment is proper make sure if you've been working on some changes in your swing you're testing it under pressure with some easier conditions so i think it's a great tune up for what the rest of the year could be especially this year when you have so many big events coming up early in the year i've always thought it's a great way to reaffirm what i've done until now especially going to a week like torrey i mean it will be hard to go from playing the plantation course to then going to torrey pines they're complete opposite golf courses so i'm glad you have an event like this one to basically settle in hopefully get another win like i did a few years ago and get the year started properly besides being a great event with a lot of history it's a great way to test yourself and reaffirm what you've been doing,0
jon rahm,1,2023-01,2023,7,1,0,1,we've made a lot about the fact of the strength of field here this year i think the pga tour is saying it's the strongest field they have had here this century some of that is obviously guys like you have played here fairly consistently but when you see something like that or you see five of the top seven in the world at a place does that grab your attention,i wouldn't know what to tell you,0
jon rahm,1,2023-01,2023,127,1,0,1,you shot the first round over there,no nothing i play to win every single time so there's no i wouldn't know what to say to that it's just the fact of getting it done getting the first win is obviously a huge bonus if you can do it early i think i did it on my th th start as a pro on the pga tour it's early in someone's career so that gives you a lot of confidence but it's basically doing what you already believed you could do at least in my case so just more confidence moving forward i didn't do anything different from the first time i teed it up and in the future first day on thursday my intention is to win and that's never going to change,0
jon rahm,1,2023-01,2023,261,1,0,1,being from san diego you talked about torrey pines you've always been so confident and comfortable there after winning the u s open does that make it even more so or does that change anything about playing at torrey pines,well i remember not make being birdie on when i needed to i remember making a few mistakes during the day that could have allowed me to have a better chance it was great to see luke list luke list was i think my first pga tour member round was with luke list at the then safeway open both of the players in the playoff are guys with immense talent it was good to see one of them get their first win plus that unique situation with their tee shots ending up in the same spot and having to do a weird drop and the whole situation and then luke hitting it to a foot on what could be considered an easy shot but it's gotten the best of some people in the past i've definitely seen a few spin it back in the water so it was great to see him get it done and it was great for will to then go on and draw from the experience from a playoff and get it done in memphis i don't know for some reason that event always gives you a thrilling ending i've had the luck of being part of a few of them in both sides because the year marc leishman won i had a chance to tie him again for a playoff and didn't make the putt so i've been on both sides of those endings but yeah for some reason torrey always brings the excitement and that speaks to the greatness of the golf course and tournament,0
jon rahm,1,2023-01,2023,126,1,0,1,this was a little bit of the beginning of a new era on the pga tour with this being the first designated event is there anything cool about that for you to win the first one and did it feel at all different or did it feel the same as last year,it didn't feel any different at all not really a difference just a different way to qualify for the tournament but during covid in we had the same people qualify for the tournament so it's a little i wouldn't know what to say right it's not really any different i think we might see a bigger difference in full field events more than this one i think you'll see a difference in a couple others but this one is so unique and it's got such a strong character with what it is to me it didn't feel any different it really shouldn't feel any different but it's i'm going to say obviously a great start for me for what's going to be a very different year,0
jon rahm,1,2023-01,2023,25,1,0,1,how hard is it to play with a big lead like that of six seven eight nine strokes,i don't know if i've played with a lead like that on the pga tour i've done it on the european tour i've been lucky,0
jon rahm,1,2023-01,2023,198,0,1,1,if you can go back in time to where you were when you won at torrey pines the u s open to now what's different about your game and how much better would you say you are if at all,you're picking a very specific week i can tell you i was much more comfortable with my swing at the u s open than i have been in all the wins since not that i'm uncomfortable i'm just saying i was very in command of my game that week and very very comfortable especially on that golf course it's just experience living certain moments is always going to make you better i think my short game has become a little bit better a little bit sharper especially maybe from the to yard range i've improved in some things that made me a little bit better as well not that it's shots that you often see but actually out here you need it quit a bit so i think that part of my game have been a little bit better my putting i think might be a bit better as well but if i get picky i'm going to find a lot of little things that i'm going to find better than i did back then at the end of the day i tee it up every week full confidence that i can win no matter how i'm feeling,0
jon rahm,1,2023-01,2023,68,1,0,1,MODERATOR,well it's always great to be back i've had some success here in the past and highlighted by the battle i had with cam last year on the final round i mean those scores were pretty incredible the three lowest scores ever on a pga tour event were out here so hoping to have another good showing this year and start the year off on a positive note,0
jon rahm,1,2023-01,2023,65,1,1,1,well in the golf department then do you feel like there's a sense of i don't know if calm is the right word or feeling of turning a new page where you kind of know where you stand at this point,yeah i mean i think we all know where we stand there's still going to be players that choose to transition to liv is my guess but for a lot of us i think we see the direction the pga tour is going towards right i mean they're making the necessary changes to adapt to the new age and i think it's better for everybody,0
jon rahm,1,2023-01,2023,148,1,0,1,what are you curious about this year most curious about not so much how you play but in the whole arena of golf,curious i haven't thought about that it's going to be a different year right there's a lot more highlights in the calendar year i would say for the pga tour all those elevated events one thing i keep going back to laughing and it's probably only funny to me but i think the masters champions dinner's going to be a little tense compared to how it's been in the past so i keep thinking about it because i wish i could be there and just be able to see how things work out too bad the u s open doesn't have one of those but yeah i think it's an exciting year obviously we're all curious about how it's going to work out but we're all excited to see what this year's going to how it's going to unfold and how it's going to play out for everybody,0
jon rahm,1,2023-01,2023,127,0,1,1,two things if i could just kind of lean into those and you touched on one of them already but the majors are going to be the four events of the year where everybody probably comes together how do you think the dynamics will be different champions dinner notwithstanding,i think it's going to be the same i mean i didn't feel a difference in any of the majors last year if somebody has a problem with liv players they're just not going to deal with them and that's about it in my mind like i've said it before i respect their choice and the ones i was friends with before i'm still going to be friends with right it doesn't change the way i'm going to operate with them so i think a lot of let's say animosity if there's any might be created more by you guys than anything else i don't think there's that much of a problem between players at least in person because if there is they can avoid each other,0
jon rahm,1,2023-01,2023,22,0,1,1,do you get any sense you wouldn't know how to answer this probably but someone with liv a d j or a brooks or someone like i have to wonder if they wouldn't feel any more pressure representing a flag they're playing under a league they're playing under to perform in a major than they ordinarily would have if it was not this way,i mean i don't know i think you touched on two guys that i don't think really care much where they're playing,0
jon rahm,1,2023-01,2023,174,1,1,1,what do you hope happens,what i hope i hope europe wins that's about that listen there's some people that are going to have to make some tough choices right a little bit of that is out of my reach my guess is i hope the pga of america and european tour make a decision together i don't think it would be smart to have one team allowing liv players and one not to and besides that even if they decide not to on that side i think it's going to give an opportunity for a lot of great young players to show up and have the chance in europe right it's just going to be an opportunity for all of them we saw a younger u s team last ryder cup and they did what they did so i'm hoping these younger guys who have grown up watching the ryder cup and seeing their idols do what they do let's say it energizes the team a little bit in any manner and we show up there to win,0
jon rahm,1,2022-11,2022,108,1,0,1,a win on pga tour and a win in your own national championship and a win here how would you sum up,hopefully people can stop telling me that it was a bad year three wins world wild three wins in three different continents yeah it wasn't a major championship but it's still a really really good season you know had a second boy this year a lot of changes at home it also helps i got a lot of videos from my kids back home laughing and doing things i do draw from some memories kelley sent me a video of our youngest eneko when he was clapping and that's what i was thinking on the last few holes hopefully try to make him clap a little bit more,0
jon rahm,1,2022-11,2022,192,1,0,1,you are under par for this tournament in the three years that you've played which is under par average more than that which usually wins golf tournaments and you've won it twice over the three times you've played can you just pinpoint what are the things you really like on a golf course on this golf course that absolutely suits your eyes,i hope not it's very unprecedented right what we've been dealing with in the game of golf in the last it hasn't even been that long what six months and there's certainly going to be a before and after at some point and there's definitely some division going on but i think to the core fans who have been fans of sergio i don't think they care really where he plays some of them might but most of them i don't really think they care it still shouldn't change what he's done in the game what he's done in the ryder cup european tour pga tour shouldn't be affected by where he decides to play golf at least in my mind it could have somewhat of an impact i have a hard time believing a lot of those players are going to have a positive impact with their legacy right now we don't know what's going to happen but if it does i hope it's not a big one let's say it that way he's done a lot for the game of golf so it would be sad to see that change,0
jon rahm,1,2022-11,2022,201,1,0,1,could i just ask about next season are you going to commit to the events,how do i rate you're putting me in a difficult position here he's played amazing golf to win the fedexcup and to have a chance to win the race to dubai as well it's unique this would be i think the second time in his career he wins both which is quite an accomplishment he's played amazing i think the only thing he will tell you that's missing is a major championship of having a pretty amazing year it's great to see somebody with his platform to take a stand as he did whether you agree with it or not he's taken a stand on what he believes in and that's it i think it's great he's had a lot of input he's been on the board of the pga tour and tried to make a change to be honest with how long those meetings are and how much as players we talk to each other to play as good as he has is pretty remarkable i mean in this profession we are all basically ceos of our own little golf company and now he has invested in so much more again the role he's had in both is quite incredible,0
jon rahm,1,2022-11,2022,189,0,1,1,we're in the early stages of the sort of re working of the owgr the immediate perception is that the dp world tour has been adversely affected as a result i just wondered what your take is on that and whether you feel the tour is being treated correctly what's your take,we need to stop giving liv the publicity they are not asking for it that's the first thing i'm going to say i think a lot of people are against them having world ranking points i'm not necessarily against it but there should be adjustments if your requirement is to have world ranking points as holes and a cut maybe you don't award them percent of the points since they are not fulfilling all of the requirements i also believe it's probably a couple year process so they need to respect that as every other tour has but yeah i mean like we say if there's some requirements and it's only holes and you don't have a cut maybe you award them let's say the winner will get or i give them percent of them i don't know they do have some incredible players to say that dustin wasn't one of the best players this year would be a mistake so i think they could be awarded i just don't know where the math how we could work it out i don't know if they necessarily deserve per cent,0
jon rahm,1,2022-11,2022,83,0,1,1,as we're talking about world rankings and the liv thing floats around where do you stand on that for instance is that another glitch in the system,nerves are good it means it matter right so i would expect him to be nervous i was nervous i'm still nervous when i go to the first tee on thursday just because it matters right you've put a lot of work in so i wouldn't try to get away from that i would say you're here to do a job and try to win a tournament so focus on that and utilise that intensity because you can use it to your advantage,0
jon rahm,1,2022-11,2022,307,1,1,1,our playing this first round with a young scottish guy named ewen ferguson won twice this year first time he's playing here and you've probably been in this situation before but when you get a young guy like that and knowing what you've done now in your own career do you feel these guys should be nervous do you go out of your way to engage with them or do you just go out there and have your blinkers on,none of them asked me directly what i think so i don't know i know david a little bit i've never met eugenio right all i can say is i don't blame them you're in college i think if i told my dad hey dad i have an opportunity to play for million guaranteed if i say no i'll probably get smacked in the face right if i said let's see mini tour in latin america how that's going to work out or q school it's an opportunity that wasn't there and i can't tell you i would have said no i can't tell you many people would have said no i mean it's an incredible opportunity and it's a new platform with that being said i do support the pga tour youth program as somebody who actually went four years to college and earned my starts with some help i earned my starts i was invited to six events and earned my tour card that way many pro sports especially in the us it's a direct path from college to the professional ranks right i think they need to do more than what they have done i would have given more starts i would have given at least the best two guys in college a full pga tour card including invitationals no questions asked because again i'm going to say this one more time if you put the same player in this position and say you're going to make to million guaranteed the next three years or you can have some conditional status a lot of them are still going to pick liv so i would say you need more incentive for that to happen i haven't read all the policies about it but from what i've talked to people i still would have given them,0
jon rahm,1,2022-11,2022,202,1,0,1,i met eugenio quite a few times and he's a big big fan of yours what did you think of this entire situation of young athletes just coming out and going through potentially making more money golf as careers you are a big influence on them what are your thoughts and do you think the pga tour has done the right thing by increasing the number of pga tour u the university rankings,listen it's above my pay grade to know how the math works and i understand they are prioritising is not the word but they are giving certain value to the depth of the field as well and the ranking on the lower parts of the lower but would you rather win a tournament when you have the no player in the world there or because you have the th or th there i think it's more valuable if you're betting best players in the world i think a lot of people would agree and i think it should reflect that and if it's not like that at least the point gap shouldn't be as vastly different as it is right now because we are not talking about the best pga tour events in the season where you have multiple multiple high ranked players we are talking about a tournament that didn't even have one player in the top that to me is an issue when you have seven of them here i don't know what the fix is right i understand what they were trying to do when they changed some things but i think like i said they missed the mark,0
jon rahm,1,2022-09,2022,111,0,1,1,you had a fantastic week here in and you were very close to danny who eventually crossed the line looks like less than challenging weather,hopefully it's kind of like today where it looked that bad but wasn't that bad maybe one hour delay and but that's the chance you take when you come it the u k and a chance you take when you come to london although until this week it's been wonderful weather but it's part of golf i sometimes welcome it because living in arizona i don't seat a cloud for a large part of the year it's very very hot coming here and playing different golf is always very welcoming especially wentworth it's very historic and there are a lot of great champions and a golf course worthy of great champions,0
jon rahm,1,2022-09,2022,151,1,0,1,MODERATOR,yeah i definitely haven't played the last few years as much of the dp world tour as i would like obviously there's been some changes going on in the pga tour that might make it a little more difficult but it's important that we have dates like this one because it makes a lot easier for us to come and also i play in spain to have one of those events be as big as it is not conflicting with any other big ones in the us makes it a lot easier like i said this venue really really is something that i look forward to i'm happy that i can be here for the first time this year i did play the scottish open but to be a full dp world event i'm happy to be here and hoping that i can play a lot more times in the future,0
jon rahm,1,2022-09,2022,295,1,1,1,how important is it for you to be taking this opportunity this week to in a sense be supporting the dp world tour given how much focus that's been on the pga tour and what's going on in the game right now and for this european tour getting back into the limelight,somewhat i do believe i do think there is a bit of a double standard between the relationship with liv and pga tour and liv and european tour i think the pga tour will and can honestly survive without some big players going but the european tour there are many key players that have been key for european tour golf and the ryder cup that have a lot of collective years on the european tour that them coming i don't necessarily think it's a bad thing what i don't understand is some players that have never shown any interest in european tour have never shown any interest in playing this event being given an opportunity just because they can get world ranking points and hopefully make majors next year a perfect example a good friend of mine is the first one out on the entry list right now alfredo a good friend of mine from spain because you have players that you know might need world ranking points are given an opportunity that i don't really agree with it really to an extent i don't know what the word is it doesn't hurt me but it does bug me that somebody who has played over i think i looked it up it's dp world events this year cannot be given the opportunity to play a flagship event because some people that earned it to an extent are being given an opportunity when they couldn't care any less about the event they don't know they don't care they don't know the history of this event they are only here because they are trying to get world ranking points and trying to finish in the top and that's clear as day so to me there's a difference,0
jon rahm,1,2022-09,2022,4,0,1,1,obviously there is the liv backdrop at the moment rory mcilroy saying that he found it hard to stomach playing alongside liv golfers this week do you share similar concerns do you feel the same way,alfredo alfredo garcia heredia,0
jon rahm,1,2022-09,2022,148,1,0,1,this could be a career changing week for them,yeah like i said the likes of sergio and westy and poulter have spent plus years on the european tour i don't necessarily think that denying them the entry to some events is a bad thing but there is some players i'm not going to name any anybody but there's some of them that have never shown any interest like i said they are here for a different motive than supporting european tour sorry dp world yeah i don't necessarily think it's because those players have been coming here for many years and they usually come it's still a larger number than it should be maybe i know according to the laws they earned it in some way but i have a hard time i know that if they were playing the pga tour they wouldn't be here for a fact so to me it's hard to understand,0
jon rahm,1,2022-09,2022,131,1,0,1,and that makes it more annoying,yeah it's definitely an odd scenario because there's more animosity going on in the world of golf than we've ever had but it could be a change for the better right we can see the pga tour making changes to increase purse size and increase opportunities for all players and i'm sure they are also going to do that here right so to an extent i can see it as a positive for change or change that was maybe needed because things haven't changed in a very long time in the world of golf and something needs to be done as bad as things are right now i think give it enough time we might look at it as a positive for them i'm hoping i'm hoping good comes with it,0
jon rahm,1,2022-09,2022,214,1,0,1,how would you feel if you went to play with them,i'm not surprised i'm not surprised i was always in the position of understanding that many big players were going to leave it is understandable it's guaranteed a lot of money right and it's a different format less golf less stress as glamorous as it can be the a professional golfer can be very stressful you play a lot of golf and you don't always get the feedback you want so it can be tough to travel worldwide and miss a cut and get nothing that part can be tough i'm not surprised some big players have gone and that's why i said i think that's why changes are being made especially on the pga tour side to make sure that doesn't happen again yeah i think early on a lot of the people that had an easier decision was people whose careers were towards the end later years but i think it would have been foolish to think no young player was ever going to go because obviously it's an opportunity and i think a lot of them are going to think it's a good one especially the ones who were amateurs who signed crazy big contracts and now have the opportunity to play with some of the best players in the world,0
jon rahm,1,2022-09,2022,2,0,1,1,you've been very consistent about your own position regarding liv are you surprised at the calibre of players who have eventually gone because we all thought it was going to be players whose best years were behind them and do you think that's going to force people to take a different perspective,no never,0
jon rahm,1,2022-09,2022,331,1,0,1,has it caused you to have second thoughts about your decision,so that's actually something i haven't talked to keith pelley about but i would love to hopefully i can catch him for five minutes i hope maybe between some of the europeans that play pga tour more full time we can reach an agreement of maybe figuring out a schedule to where it makes it easier for us to come right an example for me because of the ryder cup i wanted to play italian open this year and i could have but we had a young one a month ago and i don't want to be gone for five out of six weeks of his life right early on for next year i want to play to play the italian open so reaching an agreement that maybe i can go to the be great for me obviously they can't change the tournament based on only one person but for future years if we can somehow change the schedule with the changes the pga tour is having because eventually with all these big events we are going to end up playing most of the same events rory and i will be playing very very similar schedules except for two or three events so i think we can reach a point or a certain agreement where we can come here more often i would love to have more time off in the fall i said it on the other side i'll say it here i'd love to finish in august and have a chance to have quite a bit of time off and be a father and be a husband because from january to august it's all about golf now with my kids being young i can already feel it i can only imagine when they are older and taking them to school and picking them up and they have their sport duties and things like that i'm hoping eventually we can reach a schedule that allows me to come here enough,0
jon rahm,1,2022-09,2022,296,1,0,1,will the way that the pga tour is being reshaped impact on how often we see you over this side of the atlantic and are the rules going to have to change to enable you to play those,i mean there's only one problem in life that doesn't have a solution and that's death that's it everything else has a solution if european tour really want them to play and as a team we want them to play i think a solution can be reached if every party is not happy about it i don't know i also do think both pga of america and european tour need to make a decision together because i don't think it would be fair for one side to allow them to play and one side not allow them to play i've said many times how important the ryder cup is to me i talked to my dad the other day about and if it wasn't for the ryder cup i probably wouldn't be here because that's the reason why he started playing golf therefore why i started playing golf so i believe the ryder cup is above all in my mind it is the greatest marketing tool golf has one of the biggest sporting events period right so i wouldn't mind me and sergio had a great great experience in this last ryder cup and i would love to repeat it above all no matter where he plays but i can understand why it would be difficult if it was up to me i would love to reach a resolution to some of them being able to play because like i said earlier how many ryder cups has sergio played ten most points ever earned in the ryder cup westy has been a part of a lot of them as well and many others i don't know if it will be possible or not but i think if there's a way i would like to see it,0
jon rahm,1,2022-09,2022,128,0,1,1,at this point obviously we don't know which way the legalities are going to call around ryder cup selection in particular given the depth of feeling we've heard obviously what rory mcilroy has said very pointedly about the guys who have crossed over is it in any way feasible to think that liv golfers and those who have stayed with the traditional tours could apply on the same ryder cup team when you think about things like team camaraderie and how important that is,i found out about the meeting this morning so i will try i think if the weather opens up i might try to play a few holes after this and go to the meeting i think you learn everything in life by listening so that's what i'm going to do i don't really have much to say my position on things has been clear and unless i'm asked directly by somebody i'm just going to listen because one thing we haven't done outside media is really truly hear what the other side have to say i do believe there needs to be a dialogue started instead of throwing just negative comments against each other if you ever want to reach a solution there needs to be a conversation,0
jon rahm,1,2022-08,2022,197,1,1,1,and then i did have one liv question actually as it related to the hearing last week or the outcome of the hearing did you find yourself not watching it necessarily but at least paying attention to it and would it have been at all awkward if the boys had been let in,well i can tell you i had zero attention on it i only found out that it was going on because i walked by player dining and i saw about ten really nervous people pacing all around the room and i thought well there's something going on i asked and heard what was going on but i never really i was in the room when the judge made her decision known but only because i was walking by and they told me it was time so i was like yeah i'll stay i think it could have made things a little bit awkward yeah they chose to leave the pga tour they chose to go join another tour knowing the consequences and then try to come back and get you know courts and justice in the way wouldn't have i would say sit extremely well with me but at the same time they are adults right they are free to do as they please to an extent and that's what they chose to do if they are allowed by a judge i'm nobody to say otherwise would have been awkward possibly but i guess we'll never know,0
jon rahm,1,2022-08,2022,88,1,1,1,did you get any sense that we're not going to see these guys for a while,i mean it doesn't look like it i'm confident that the liv side of things are still going to push strong to keep trying to change some things but also know that the lawyers on the pga tour side are going to keep fighting for the way things are going right now it's not the last thing we are going to hear from them but i don't know i just started watching the show suits so i'm kind of learning now about what happens in a courtroom laughter,0
jon rahm,1,2022-08,2022,137,1,1,1,following up on that when you look at the top six in last year's bmw three of them are in liv now and not here what's your perspective this time around with some of those great players not here,one of the great things about the pga tour is the depth of field and three of them won but we got will zalatoris and cameron young who are two amazing players that have played amazing this year and the rise of many other great stars so there's always a hungrier future star coming that's willing to put in the work and make themselves known lack of talent on the pga tour and the world of golf is not an issue again you might have lost some names but you're gaining some great golfers and those two players have done amazing this year and made themselves known i don't think we are essentially losing that much because like i said you're just getting to know some great players that were there that you haven't heard of before,0
jon rahm,1,2022-08,2022,77,1,1,1,one more on that there have been various reports that tiger is coming in today to talk to some of the players about the pga tour and liv can you give any insight,boy news can be wrong sometimes yeah there is a player meeting but that's all i can tell you about that there's also a pac meeting i don't know if on the news they were talking about the pac meeting or no i saw alan shipnuck tweeted something the most reliable source in golf i don't know what to tell you i don't have tiger's phone number so i can't tell you if he's coming or not,0
jon rahm,1,2022-08,2022,304,1,0,1,i wanted to go back to and talk about your start on the tour we've seen over the years a number of really good amateurs college players and they either haven't won yet out here struggled out here some don't make it out here it could be hard sometimes to tell what the progression is going to be like and from your standpoint i was curious if you knew you were good and what kind of level of confidence did you have that you were going to succeed however you want to measure success,lack of confidence has never been an issue for me i've always been extremely confident in my abilities but unlike many amateur or college players i was able to test myself on pga tour events and phoenix being a massive one and compete at what i it wasn't my a game but still post a top five and actually have a decent chance of being up there so that gave me a massive boost of confidence of confirming what i already knew that i had the talent to be out there and play with some great players that have played really good in the past when i turned pro and i went to congressional to the rocket mortgage event i only had one goal in mind i had six events to get my card but i can guarantee you i was trying to win those six events and almost succeeded twice so again i've said it many times when i tee it up in a tournament i tee it up to win and that's what i try to do and thanks to some of those showings in the past i know i have the ability to play my game and i knew my game was enough to get a win now with that said a lot of it is also how you're mentally prepared to handle it life as a pga tour golfer is not easy and that's the reason why i stayed a fourth year in college was to get ready i could have turned pro as a junior and i didn't because i didn't feel like i was ready i also promised my family i was going to graduate i think having an extra year to get ready and mentally prepare for what pga tour life is helped me out a lot,0
jon rahm,1,2022-08,2022,182,1,0,1,lastly as a student of the game when you see young kids coming through in college is there anyone that you can i'm not looking for a name but can you look at somebody and say oh yeah this guy can't miss,i think it kind of goes back to what i said earlier i think a lot of them have the physical talent to be pga tour golfers it's all up to what's here i don't know you don't know what's going on in their head you don't know how they are thinking and you literally don't know there's many first round draft picks that don't make it that are supposed to make it there's so many things that go into it it could be you get a small injury right that can maybe that path a little different you have family situations you have personal situations there's so many variables that go into it and i consider you need to work very hard and to an extent get lucky to have an entry to the pga tour the likes of mine or jordan spieth or tiger and phil a little different or people that make it straight through college like matt wolfe like collin you need more than physical talent it's what's in the head and how you can handle the life,0
jon rahm,1,2022-07,2022,256,0,1,1,he said so he said it could be his last,he said it well if he's saying it then sorry about that then i'm glad i was there we were joking on the tee that if it wasn't for us having to wait those ten minutes we would have had a downwind shot as we're standing on the tee with iron in my mind we feel the breeze change i'm thinking well i hope i have a good driver to have a good number to the pin so it feels a little bittersweet in that sense luckily i was able to make birdie i'm hoping this is not tiger's last i'm hoping somehow he can get healthier and be back from what i heard it will be in which is eight years from now which is probably a few years too long i wouldn't be surprised if he makes the effort just to play and do a proper good bye wish him nothing but the best obviously he's done amazing things here and amazing things everywhere in the world at this point hoping he can stay healthy and live a normal life from now on you can tell he's in pain i know he puts a front out there and he tries to walk normal but you can tell in certain moments going down some of the hills you can tell he's suffering so hopefully they can not fully fix it i don't know if they'll be able to but minimise it and have a normal life as normal life as tiger woods can have obviously,0
jon rahm,1,2022-07,2022,89,1,0,1,what do you think is your biggest takeaway from brookline what was your biggest learning moment,no i think it's pretty equal throughout to be honest because my first few years i still played the pga after the open sometimes when i get to the open i don't feel like it's the last one i don't know how long it will get to set in but i wouldn't want to go to the first tee on thursday thursday on with the urge of having to win because it's the last one not really it's just being the tournament it is it's a big enough deal,0
jon rahm,1,2022-07,2022,114,1,0,1,from what you do week to week on the pga tour the dp world tour to come and tackle links golf what's the biggest thing you have to adapt,you've got to control your spin a lot better a lot of times we play tour in the us even though it's windy you need to the speed of the greens and how far you can hit it out here you can get more distance off the tee and then coming into the green you can avoid and you can use certain slopes and certain shots to get it close to the pin there's a couple shots on the last few holes with short irons i left myself a little bit too short you've just got to be in control of the trajectory right pulling the right club and being committed to the shot,0
jon rahm,1,2022-07,2022,101,0,1,1,MODERATOR,yeah selfishly i can say that for somebody who plays both tours to have one event that counts not only as a start but it can count for both tours it's a wonderful thing you can come over and play well in europe to travel over for european players that live in the states it's a huge help i think it's wonderful for the game of golf you get more players that maybe wouldn't have come to this event to come and see this beautiful course and play in scotland looking forward to it and i can't wait to get started,0
jon rahm,1,2022-07,2022,202,1,1,1,is this event now that it's much bigger because of the collaboration between the european tour and the pga tour how important is this preparation for st andrews next week,so i think it's very important to play an event when you're trying to get ready for a major like the open championship we don't play when you live in the us you don't see anything like it all year round it takes a bit of adjusting to get your golf game ready for links golf you have to be able to control your spin trajectory and ball flight and try to use the ground a lot more than we are used to in the us being able to come the week before and have such a strong field it's an added bonus now with st andrews yeah playing in the open the at the old course it's the dream of every golfer especially a european golfer and to be the th edition it's something that's very very significant i can't imagine again i can't tell you how many times i've seen the images of seve celebrating his winning putt and it would be amazing to hopefully be able to join my name to that list to be honest i don't think there's a bigger achievement in golf than winning the open championship at st andrews i think it's the biggest event,0
jon rahm,1,2022-07,2022,87,0,1,1,the inevitable liv question how do you feel about i think there were four players who have been added to the field having successfully appealed against their sanctions,yeah i found out recently the best way i can describe it is simply not my business not my decision so they are allowed to play in the competition it is what it is i truly don't know how or what really happened so i don't know as much as i probably should to be able to answer the question but yeah i think what's important is that we have a great championship at hand and not let the golf politics dictate how good the tournament is,0
jon rahm,1,2022-07,2022,108,1,1,1,their attitude seems to be well if you want to play liv golf then fine don't play and don't come back here would you go along with that that if players are going to go don't try ask come back and play on the dp world tour,again it's not my decision there have been a lot of members that have been both members of pga tour and european tour i think it's a bit it wouldn't be too logical to expect them to play all three tours i don't think it's really more than that yeah i understand where they are coming from european tour and pga tour have done a wonderful job for so many years and have been given those players a platform to play golf and make a living if they choose to leave to play a different tour i wouldn't necessarily think they should be expected to be welcomed back,0
jon rahm,1,2022-07,2022,173,1,0,1,i'm sure you're familiar with the expansion alliance between the pga tour and the dp world tour can you explain to me from a pga tour what the benefit is for the pga tour players,i think it's more playing opportunities in that sense this is a perfect example if it's a pga tour that's also in the open and wanted to play this week this is a clear path this is the beginning of hopefully more than one that is a co sanctioned event and giving players a chance to come to europe and play more golf there is some wonderful events here in europe without speaking to most of the players about it i think a lot of them would love to come and have a chance to play some are trying to go play italy maybe make it a vacation at the same time sounds pretty good to me yeah like i said i do see also what you're asking there's a lot of european tour players now that have more clear path to the pga tour and there are some great events there as well it's going to be easier for each one to do basically transfer if you want to play one tour,0
jon rahm,1,2022-06,2022,116,0,1,1,you seem to be someone who really appreciates history is this place and the history and the aura of it is it inspiring you does it make you love the golf course more,i might be biased in that sense it's a place when you come into and you start hearing the stories and you go in the locker room and you see the pictures and the essence of what's happened it makes it that much more special it's true living history on this golf course you're taking steps on holes that some greats have in the past when you get to and you hear everything that's happened on that hole it's very very unique yeah it's very enjoyable it's kind of obviously like going to augusta or a place like riv colonial courses that have been hosting events for a long time and are part of this game,0
jon rahm,1,2022-06,2022,192,1,0,1,with the masters and pga behind you now and here as a defending champ what does this weekend feel like is there pressure is it go out and play golf like you said what does it feel like for you,laughing i think that can change every single day i think the golf club not only for me but for everybody the one that can save a round no matter how bad you hit is the putter short game in general my swing coach back in spain eduardo used to say that the short game is like the hospital when your long game is sick the hospital usually nurses you back to health and that's what he used to tell me i've taken that to heart i would always say to every junior player i find make sure your short game is good before you develop your long game i think that's very very important developing your feel i think any club can get you in a lot of trouble but if you overuse the driver you can get in some issues at the same time nowadays it looks like the golf game is developing using more driver right so i really can't tell you if it's a good day it's really not going to get you in trouble short game and putting is always going to get you out of it,0
jon rahm,1,2022-06,2022,404,1,1,1,just for what's going on in golf right now and liv there's been a lot of thoughts rory was talking earlier about voicing his opinion on the players that have gone the players that have stayed and just the state of the tour i'm curious where your thoughts are for you personally and also broadly in terms of where you see golf where you see golf right now and where it's going,i almost feel i feel for jay monahan if you see his time as a commissioner he had to deal with covid and now this i don't know if he signed up for all this or not i consider the pga tour has done an amazing job giving us the best platform for us to perform i do see the appeal that other people see towards the liv golf i do see some of the i'll put this delicately points or arguments they can make towards why they prefer it to be honest part of the format is not really appealing to me shotgun three days to me is not a golf tournament no cut it's that simple i want to play against the best in the world in a format that's been going on for hundreds of years that's what i want to see yeah money is great but when kelley and i this first thing happened we started talking about it and we're like will our lifestyle change if i got million no it will not change one bit truth be told i could retire right now with what i've made and live a very happy life and not play golf again so i've never really played the game of golf for monetary reasons i play for the love of the game and i want to play against the best in the world i've always been interested in history and legacy and right now the pga tour has that there's meaning when you win the memorial championship there's meaning when you win arnold palmer's event at bay hill there's a meaning when you win la torrey some of the historic venues that to me matters a lot right after winning this past u s open only me and tiger have won at torrey pines and it's a golf course that we like making putts on the th hole that's a memory i'm going to have forever that not many people can say my heart is with the pga tour that's all i can say it's not my business or my character to judge anybody who thinks otherwise for a lot of people i'm not going to lie those next three four years are worth basically their retirement plan they're giving them it's a very nice compensation to then retire and sail off into the sunset if that's what you want that's fine,0
jon rahm,1,2022-06,2022,1,1,0,1,for you is that something you have thought about in terms of an alternate league and how would you weigh the value of what the pga tour has done versus what other players are going to do,yeah,0
jon rahm,1,2022-06,2022,178,1,0,1,just as a quick follow up obviously your fellow countryman sergio is playing for them,zero like i said not my business he has given golf european tour and the pga tour years of his life if his decision is to go play and play less events and enjoy it's his decision it's not my job to judge that's all i can say i don't know what's going to happen i think the one thing that keeps coming to me out of all this and what can happen i hope the ryder cup doesn't suffer i think the ryder cup is the biggest attraction the game of golf has to bring new people in and i have such a good time with him on the golf course and on the previous one in paris i hope we don't lose the essence and the aspect that the ryder cup is that's one of my biggest concerns to be honest it's an event we all play for free and it's one of our favorite weeks win or lose i think that says a lot about the game and where i wish it would be at,0
jon rahm,1,2022-06,2022,150,1,0,1,what have the conversations been like with him in terms of his decision making process,well are they going to be able to play ryder cup or not the players that went in my mind sergio even if he is not breaking he's a no brainer pick right so what's going to happen you have quite a few young americans bryson went somebody that's probably going to be on the team in the future phil's captaincy is probably in question now where the pga stands on all of this we don't know the european side of things yet i have no idea what's going on or what's going on with the european tour in a worst case scenario i don't know what's going to happen how many people may not be able to be around the ryder cup and things like that like i said i think a week like that is a true essence of the game that's where we all love to play,0
jon rahm,1,2022-06,2022,243,1,1,1,are you surprised that liv has kind of gotten this far and then i guess the second part to this question is do you feel maybe that the cloud is less now that they've had a tournament in the books the cloud is less this week than it was the last few months or is it more,i have no idea i really don't know i'm sure that's something that jay and andy pazder are thinking about and i'm assuming there will be changes in the future that would probably try to prevent that from happening but i don't know i think that the one thing we've got to realize is liv golf is a player tour what about the other hundreds of players that want to make it they don't really have a path to get there you get signed or not but you need some type of a name to get there right what about the other players that are worthy probably have a lot of talent but haven't shown it yet they all need a platform again pga tour has been that platform forever it's all i can say one of the reasons why i made it on tour so easily or quickly is because the pga tour had faith in me and i was given seven starts as an amateur before i even turned pro seven i played i believe five events as an amateur and gained a ton of experience i don't know if you can do that when they're limited to players that's one of the things i don't know what's going to happen but it's more let's say the people out of the elite small number what's going on with them they all need a platform again pga tour is the best platform,0
jon rahm,1,2022-06,2022,91,1,0,1,jon if more players go to this tour if more good players are tempted by this money what is the tipping point at which the pga tour really is negatively impacted,i'm pretty sure i realized it right away laughing like i've said before i think getting the first major was a big weight off my shoulders i think the surprise is i didn't expect it to be that right away when everything happened and i was done with it with all the media obligations it was just i felt so tired and just could just take a breath and sigh of relief from what had happened obviously the euphoria came afterwards but i didn't realize my first reaction would be that,0
jon rahm,1,2022-06,2022,8,0,1,1,you've spoken about the kind of golfing concerns you have with the whole liv setup i just wonder do you have any concerns over the source of their funding as well i e saudi arabia,i've seen a little bit of it already,0
jon rahm,1,2022-05,2022,211,1,0,1,did you watch the broadcast last sunday a year ago last sunday,nothing nothing really well i mean i would probably i wouldn't want to jinx myself but i would tell myself in a second i got a little frustrated don't worry you're going to win the u s open but besides that nothing really i mean i watched it with a lot of grace i was having fun i kind of tuned in looking to see how close they got to under which is where i was at obviously sunday was a windy day and it was a tough one but still i wanted to watch i'm a golf fan and i wanted to see who was going to win like i said there was no guarantee that i was going to but i had a pretty good chance the only thing i've said in the past don't give me the win that's fine but i am very comfortable i was going to be top so at least give me a top for the career stats not a wd because i've never withdrawn of a tournament as a pro once i started and i hate that so at the least the pga tour if they are listening just give me the top you now i think i would have shot that day,0
jon rahm,1,2022-05,2022,127,1,0,1,as somebody who's been world no and a major champion what advice would you give to somebody who's young who has that kind of potential for the sport,it's a different sport it's hard to give a general advice that hasn't already been heard believe in yourself and keep working i would probably tell him and i don't know how it works in the world of tennis but you see a lot of people who golf who get to the pga tour a certain level and they think they need to change things because someone or people they win a major championship and they decide they need to change things because they need it to get better there's a reason he's gotten to this point just keep using that routine and keep getting better don't need to do a complete flip just keep believing in yourself keep practicing and keep training and results will come,0
jon rahm,1,2022-04,2022,234,0,1,1,jon we've seen just great runs of golf by you by the younger players by scottie has golf ever seen more i guess age of parity,i think the last maybe seven years of golf since with jordan jason day dustin rory brooks myself justin thomas if i didn't say him many other great players now with cameron and scottie it's a perfect example of the tiger effect all of us are close in age and we all dustin being a little bit older but the rest of us we're all within five years and we all grew up watching tiger we all grew up wanting to be him and we all grew up with the dream of being major champions with the advancement in golf in all of us thinking of ourselves as athletes you can see the difference everybody can reach a new level it's really hard to stay up there for a long time some players have been able to do it but it's just the next guy comes up gets hot and there you go it's a beautiful part of the golden age of golf we're living in right now you might not get hopefully it's me but you might not get the one guy that's going to dominate for a long time but you're going to get five six maybe ten players that can do their part anybody gets hot for three four months and you can see what happens patrick cantlay too i forgot him he played pretty good last year too and bryson,0
jon rahm,1,2022-04,2022,89,0,1,1,i just wanted to ask you about scottie for one second and your evaluation of his swing specifically his footwork,i don't really have much to say honestly resemblance of greg norman's footwork right that sliding right foot i think a lot of people like to point out the unusual stuff in somebody's swing but clearly it helps him deliver the club face the way he needs to it works for each one of us right it does look a little odd it does look like he's sliding but the left foot is planted and his body moves through the way it's supposed to move through so it works,0
jon rahm,1,2022-04,2022,90,0,1,1,was there any part of you that was either irritated or frustrated to lose the no ranking that you'd had for so long,not really i was asked pretty much every week oh if so and so wins you lose it when it was the other way if you win this week you get to no not really when somebody wins out of events it's pretty deserving you can't take anything away from scottie i'm happy for him this is the beauty of the game we live in now anyone can be no at any point i was able to be it for quite a bit and hoping i can get it back,0
jon rahm,1,2022-03,2022,88,1,0,1,we're obviously playing match play this week you've won the team event at zurich before i'm just curious if you have any ideas or you would like to see any other formats and if any could fit into the tour schedule,i don't know if there's any other but the diversity makes it really fun we have what plus pga tour events a year and only two that are not stroke play well three technically that are not stroke play yeah i mean it would be fun to have more different options out there i don't know what it may be but i think it would be fun to have a couple different ones just to change it up not only for us but for the spectators as well,0
jon rahm,1,2022-03,2022,95,1,0,1,why not,you can't be playing a wolf tournament out here i really have no idea how you'd do the prize and things like that and i think it would be a little bit too hectic if we're playing wolf and hammer and different games out there but i think more dual events could be really fun i think if it ever happened where you've got pga tour and lpga tour players together could be really cool just legal things that could make the game a little bit better and grow the game out a little bit,0
jon rahm,1,2022-03,2022,147,1,0,1,i'd vote for a wolf tournament but that's just me after you won the u s open at torrey pines last year did you feel like you cracked a code or is there a code for winning major championships and also what do you know about southern hills where the pga is going to be here in about a month,i wish there was a code i wish because at this point i feel like we would all know it but if there is a code it's personal to each own no i mean winning a major championship is difficult but i think getting it done gives you a little bit of that experience and belief that you have nothing to prove in that regard you just need to go out there and do what you have to do southern hills i know very little about never been there before so i'm excited to see it i've heard great things about the golf course i know it's a challenge hopefully it's not as hot as it was last time in ' which it shouldn't be because we're not going to be there in august and just looking forward to it i couldn't tell you anything about it,0
jon rahm,1,2022-03,2022,192,1,0,1,you were saying how much you're able now once you finish a round probably because of kepa probably because of another baby soon again you're able to forget about it and be present and kind of not bring any trauma or whatever from the round does it help you now approach any new tournament like the players this week like a completely new tournament and being in the moment and not having anything from the past that bothers you,it's hard it's hard to see honestly i think i saw some news that they might be targeting or not but they're bombing schools in ukraine which to me is absolutely ludicrous i don't know what goes through a human being's mind to be doing that at this day and age really i don't know i can't rationalize it in my head but it's happening and hopefully they can find a solution soon but it's sad honestly it's really sad those people in ukraine right now need help because through no fault of their own they're going through what they're going through luckily the pga tour and some of the golf industries are working on something to support that which i think a lot of us might jump on but hoping they can find at least a way to maneuver it because it's a lot of innocent people that shouldn't be going through this nobody should but i really am at a loss for words every time i think about it because i can't believe it honestly i have a hard time believing what goes through putin's mind to be doing this,0
jon rahm,1,2022-03,2022,231,0,1,1,and jack and tiger,my curfew was so i didn't get to watch much that was my thing i can't tell you how many and my parents were strict with it the only time i could miss it was to watch the first half of a soccer game that started at p m so i could get almost to to watch our soccer team that was the only time i could miss it i remember when tiger made the chip in in ' i begged my parents to stay up nope you're going to school tomorrow you can't stay up i didn't really watch that much when i was in the u s i watched the open championship a lot on the weekends i would watch a little bit more saturday but not that much honestly it's tough to even remember it just because of that i had to be to sleep so early i didn't have the time to do it there was a nine hour time difference six hour difference with florida so it was p m here and they were barely getting started but the players has always been a great event obviously i watched the majors a lot of the european events and the wgcs all the big events are big worldwide so obviously this one was very high up there even though i never got to watch it finish live,0
jon rahm,1,2022-02,2022,172,1,0,1,going through the tunnel there to it's kind of sensory overload especially considering phoenix had never actually been to a golf tournament before what did you kind of tell him to calm him down and keep him from losing consciousness,well there is nothing i can tell him to get him ready for that it's impossible i mean i still get nervous and i still don't know what to do to get ready for it the only thing i told him is like listen there is going to be a lot of people screaming enjoy it enjoy it as much as you can it's going to be very intimidating i don't know if having the loud music helped or not you can't hear the crowd as much but i'm pretty sure he had a lot of fun obviously it's easy to freeze in the moment right it's hard to take it all in looked like he had a lot of fun he was able to make that birdie tap in in i told him his first birdie on the pga tour not many year olds can say that he seemed to have a lot of fun that was the goal today he definitely has a story to tell on monday in school,0
jon rahm,1,2022-02,2022,166,0,1,1,playing a lot of golf in scottsdale in general when you're on this course does it feel similar to silverleaf or anywhere else around here does it feel kind of home,yes and no because most courses won't be able to achieve the firmness that this golf course can achieve especially with the weather we have had these greens are firm and firmer than usual you're used to playing desert golf and i think the altitude just living here i'm used to how far the ball goes which can be a challenge for some people but you know it's hard to get used to how firm and fast the greens are right i play in silverleaf a lot the greens are just as fast but they're definitely not as firm that's something you can only accomplish here plus each course is a little bit different right everybody says it tends to break towards the valley but each green is a little bit different some things you learn only by playing a golf course enough times one of the reasons i have done well is because i feel like i have a bit of the home field advantage,0
jon rahm,1,2022-02,2022,103,1,0,1,as a leader on tour no player in the world i wanted to ask your thoughts on phil mickelson's comments last week about the pga tour and what he deems to be obnoxious greed,listen i try to stay away from those things i'm here to play golf and that's about it phil has been on tour for a very long time and i'm not here to judge anybody right phil said what he said that's it he's still a great friend of mine i don't know why he said what he said or why he said how he said it but all i can say is i support him as a friend yet i don't agree with everything he said i'm years old i can count myself pretty lucky to be where i'm at in life,0
jon rahm,1,2022-02,2022,165,0,1,1,asu has produced a lot of great players they have got another one in preston summerhays i wonder if you have met him and if you see any similarities between his career and your career,i've played quite a bit with him actually they live in silverleaf me preston and tony finau have played quite a few rounds of golf i'm sure a lot of people saw when us three played together tony shot what people don't know is that preston was under through that day he's definitely a very talented player he's only a freshman in college right still has like his whole college career ahead of him do i see similarities so far no we grew up in very different environments he has a very different personality to what i have the one thing i can say you know maybe both at this point in age we are both talented golfers and he definitely is an amazing golfer and has what it takes has the tools and the determination to be out here not only be out here but be one of the best in the world i wouldn't be surprised if we see him out here soon,0
jon rahm,1,2022-02,2022,424,1,1,1,i know dj is walking with you this week how would you describe your relationship with him,great friendship you know when i first heard about what he did and what he stood for it was actually very smart of him he befriended kelley before me right she explained what dj did i seen him on the course but i didn't really know what he was working on every time he was out there i thought it was such a cool concept that as soon as i could i jumped on his team and got to meet him got to spend some time with him i think we got really close a few years ago in hawaii he was walking for somebody else in maui but we met each day at the bar that bar they had at the ritz in the lobby and we were watching college football and just hanging out came to realize how cool of a person he is and how amazing it is that somebody that was born with such a condition turns it all around and becomes such an inspiration not only for myself but to many people in this world right since the guy has walked more golf holes than i have played than most people have played actually almost double on the pga tour travels weeks out of weeks a year and is really committed to what he does and helping people out especially helping people with needs it's really really incredible really remarkable people like that like i said are very inspirational they inspire me to be a better person as a father now he could be such a great example for my son right he was born perfect had a great delivery blond blue eyes good looking has it all already to be around people like dj can put perspective in life and realize how lucky he is to be in the situation he's going to be growing up like i said me as well i'm very fortunate to call him a friend because the best thing about him is excuse my language if he needs to call you a shit head he will call you a shit head which is amazing it's one of the greatest things about him he doesn't care what you've done how much you've accomplished he cares who you are as a person that's the beauty about him i can't say enough nice things about him that's why he's a great friend of mine and hopefully he can walk with me and follow me many more tournaments and hopefully we can keep contributing to the foundation,0
jon rahm,1,2022-01,2022,101,1,1,1,MODERATOR,yes it's great to be back i haven't played the last few years because it hasn't fit the schedule and i believe last year was i had to pull out because of a bit of a back injury but i'm happy to be back it's a place i've been coming to for a very long time played in college played the nicklaus course a couple times in college and played one of the other pga courses as well so i feel comfortable i live in the desert so i always look forward to coming here and hopefully having a good week,0
jon rahm,1,2022-01,2022,147,0,1,1,to go more into that the importance of starting here starting well a place where you're comfortable what do you feel like that does for your game as the season progress obviously trying to win another championship,well i think i mentioned it earlier as well right we all put new stuff in the bag early on the year we all trying to improve as players i think it's key to get off a good start in that sense coming to courses and tournaments where i'm comfortable on is only going to help so i think that's one of the reasons but the main thing is because i come out here believing i can win each one of those events and that's the goal luckily for me it's no more than a short flight or a not the longest drive to come to these events so it's again like i said it's where i feel comfortable i spent a lot of time in california because of callaway and my swing coach dave phillips and obviously i live in arizona so it just makes sense,0
jon rahm,1,2022-01,2022,172,1,0,1,MODERATOR,well you have all the champions of the year at least most of them and you're competing against winners not that you're not throughout the year but even though it's a smaller field it's very competitive because of that you're playing against the best who have won so it's always a task to win here and it would be a great honor to be able to win then having fans is great it's a tough golf course to get people out to just because if you make it to the th green out here that means you're in great shape because this slope is no joke but there are some holes like green where they always have some stands a couple of the holes where they create a certain atmosphere and you miss it not having fans you do miss it so i'm glad we're back in maui and i'm glad we have spectators and i'm glad maui can show their support of the pga tour and us and enjoy the week,0
jon rahm,1,2021-08,2021,128,0,1,1,have you thought about what you would do with if you were to win it,save it and invest it responsibly unlike any other year old ever said i said it before we get this question every time i've been very fortunate that at my young age i make more money than i ever thought i could make i've never done this for the money but obviously it's an amazing bonus and even already i can already afford a great life for my family and the future of my family so if i haven't bought anything extravagant yet like yeah we live in a very nice house and we have some nice cars but nothing out of the very ordinary i can't really think of it nothing that would like surprise anybody or raise any eyebrows to be honest nothing that's that special,0
jon rahm,1,2021-08,2021,90,1,0,1,MODERATOR,yeah i am i'm confident to be fair i'm still a little thinking about what i could have done better already yesterday right it's still very fresh but looking forward to this week i've heard great things about the golf course i haven't been out there yet because i just got here so i'm looking at the pictures i can see around me and it looks like it's going to be a challenging one so i'm excited to get out there and hopefully make this my first pga tour defense,0
jon rahm,1,2021-08,2021,157,1,0,1,MODERATOR,well typically the venues we've played and the part of the country we play on is usually a type of golf that i like we're talking about tree lined we're talking bentgrass we're talking high rough and ball striking right so i think that is what kind of resonates with me in this event especially last year last year was a u s open let's just be honest about that and be fair that event was a u s open with a man field yeah definitely the type of golf i enjoy so looking forward to keeping it going plus the top players right it's the week before east lake so i think we're all trying to get into form right before our very last big event it's definitely something that i have in mind and like i said i can't help to think that i hope i make this my first defense on the pga tour,0
jon rahm,1,2021-08,2021,307,0,1,1,when it comes to caves valley what do you know about it being recognized around the world it's a new venue obviously to you guys but what about the reputation,you know he's a great guy he's gone through a lot and as an athlete he's somebody to look up to very easily when you're the greatest olympian of all time you definitely have a couple tricks up your sleeve a couple good moments of wisdom in that sense you've got to also understand golf and swimming are very different very different sports and i'm not going to disclose too much on what i've asked him golf wise but he has helped me a lot he has texted me every once in a while when i'm doing good or bad the last thing we talked about is trying to figure out how to play in the pro am together and that's about it you know he's been very open to my questions any time i have a question about anything he would respond the one i can talk about or that i'm willing to talk about was mainly when kepa was born he texted me right away because he was in colorado when his first child was born and he flew back for the delivery and then two days later he had to get back to keep training for the olympics he knows how hard it is to be there and then right after that gone i have to go train and not see him he did help me out with that that's not an easy feeling it wasn't the easiest thing to do even if it's the masters i really did not want to leave that room but he helped me out with that you know at the same time he's a great friend great guy to be around trying to become a good golfer and that's about it when it comes to the advice he's given me yeah i'm going to keep that for myself,0
jon rahm,1,2021-08,2021,110,1,0,1,have you ever liked it,i don't like that at all no i think you have the playoffs itself and win the first two and if you don't play good on the last one you don't you can end up with a really bad finish i don't like it i understand the system and the way i was told by one of the pga tour officials i'm a patriots fan and the patriots win the super bowl win everything and get to the super bowl and they don't win the super bowl you don't win the lombardi trophy right my answer was they still finished second they have to understand golf is a little different,0
jon rahm,1,2021-08,2021,21,1,0,1,what is your favorite ryder cup youtube moment,it's too many i still want to see i believe it was the ryder cup was there one at pga national,0
jon rahm,1,2021-08,2021,285,1,1,1,good morning jon it's obviously been a great summer for you success wise but kind of an odd one too with all that's going on off the course i'm just curious we haven't talk to you since the olympics can you tell us what happened and can you tell us what they told you because that situation was just so unusual,well the one thing i can say this was a little harder to digest than memorial because i've done everything the system tells me to do i got all my negatives first one on thursday negative friday negative saturday i get my first positive and then they tested me again that same day and i apparently was positive again then i got tested the next two days one was the saliva test one was pcr both negative got an antibody test done so blood test and i had the antibodies so i can't really explain what in the world happened i don't know if it's false positives or just what i had leftover from when i had covid just dead cells that were in there that we all know can happen there's a reason why the pga tour won't test you for a while after you've had covid so it's unfortunate and i understand it's a weird case because i tested negative so quickly and tested negative and tested negative all throughout the uk and i get here and the test is positive it really is unfortunate it sucked because i wanted to represent spain i wanted to play that one i wanted to hopefully give spain a medal i was wishing for a gold medal but just being part of that medal count for the country would have been huge it was more devastating in that sense i was more in the mindset of playing for them more than me still makes me a little sad i'm not going to lie i'm going to have to wait three more years hopefully to qualify for the olympics but i was really ready for this one,0
jon rahm,1,2021-08,2021,260,0,1,1,i take it you didn't feel ill after this one and also you kind of touched on it there but you handled this pretty well but obviously it's got to be incredibly frustrating,well i wasn't ill i can guarantee you i didn't have covid this time not at all i had five tests done four of them were negative one was positive that first time i did have covid barely any symptoms but i had it this time i had nothing listen it is what it is that's the only thing i can say it is really unfortunate it's too bad it was so late for us to watch it because we were playing at in the morning so i'm not going to lie i didn't stay up and watch the whole thing you know again it is frustrating i can't really explain it because like i said it's the unfortunate part of the times we're living i did everything i was supposed to do and i still didn't get the chance to go hopefully i don't have to deal with any of that ever again hopefully covid related and i can just keep playing golf and doing what i love and contend for tournaments but at the same time like i've said it's a reminder of the times we live in it is a serious disease the consequences can be big and i know not firsthand but i know people who have been close to me to suffer them that's why i don't take it lightly and that's why every day i'm still thankful that even then when i had it everyone around me in my family was okay and didn't get it so that's a positive side out of it,0
jon rahm,1,2021-07,2021,275,0,1,1,just wondering with the olympics coming up obviously a number of top players have decided not to play you have stated that you are very thrilled to play in the olympics can you say a little bit about why you chose to play in the olympics and why you think that many people opted out of it,i mean i can't speak for other people so i don't know why they're opting out of it you'd have to ask them i'm not going to speak for them in my case i've been really fortunate enough to represent spain at every level as an amateur since i was years old i've been able to win many team events representing spain worldwide once you turn professional you don't really get that chance you get a little bit of the ryder cup but it's not the same thing as the olympics or a world cup maybe to be able to have that chance as a pro something that up until four or five years ago was not even a possibility to me it was something i would never doubt you get the chance to call yourself an olympian which is only a very select group of people in history that can call themselves that and if you were to get a medal especially a gold medal you're even more of a select group right especially in golf i mean last time was early in the s when golf was in the olympics up until justin rose right in recent memory you would be the second one with a gold medal which to me it's very very enticing so yeah even though i can't go watch other sporting events and support my countrymen and my friends we're all going to be there and i would say in spirit not physically but to me it's a great opportunity so it would be a great great moment for me if i could deliver a gold medal for spain,0
jon rahm,1,2021-06,2021,164,1,0,1,MODERATOR,sounds good i don't know how else to say it i'm still a little bit on golf mode right i feel like when i'm in that mode it takes me a while to get out of it it probably won't happen tonight it might happen tomorrow i don't know at some point it will hit me i'm still thinking there might be a playoff i've been scarred before it's incredible that i'm sitting next to this trophy a couple weeks ago i watched my good friend phil win it not this one but win the pga and i took a lot of inspiration from that i've been close before and i just knew on a sunday the way i have been playing the last few majors i just had to be close i knew i could get it done i'm keeping that good sunday mojo going man i got it done in a fashion that apparently can only happen to me at torrey pines,0
jon rahm,1,2021-06,2021,213,1,0,1,MODERATOR,yes if you follow golf i feel like you've heard it a million times how much i love this place it's been my favorite city for a long time it was my wife's favorite city before we ever met and she used to come stay at this hilton before they knew what golf was pretty much getting my first pga tour win here the way i did with my dad watching i was really happy my dad was here at that time as a father on my first father's day with my dad here to get this one done the way i did on top of that you add the fact that we got engaged here as well and i have a very happy life i can say i'm extremely happy off the golf course but this one might steal the show for a couple of days this one is very very incredible very hard to believe that this story can round up and end up so good it almost feels like it's a movie that's about to end and i'm going to wake up soon with the setback i had a couple of weeks ago to end up like this it's incredible i do love torrey pines and torrey pines loves me,0
jon rahm,1,2021-06,2021,288,1,0,1,you mentioned phil a minute ago he had as much if not more talent than you when he turned pro it took him until he was to win his first major i know you're you're still young is there any part of you this being such a funny game that's not pressing but thinking more and more about it as you came to each major,no it's funny how it's very easy to think oh well only majors count like it's easy to win a major golf tournament i mean it's not easy that's why only a select group of people do it i feel like coming in here without having practiced much relaxed me a little bit i thought you know what in case i play bad i have an excuse i have a bailout in case i can convince myself hey i had covid but i feel like it relaxed me a little bit and ever since the sunday at the pga i felt a bit of a shift on the golf course mentally i still had that grit but almost like each miss bothered me less i couldn't tell you why i believe it's because i really set out myself to be an example for my son that he would be proud of and i've done some stuff in the past on the golf course that i'm not proud of and i wish i could eliminate it but i've accepted it i'm not saying it's going to be smooth sailing until the end but i feel like that sunday of the pga changed things a little bit my mental game was really good and it was the same thing at memorial mentally i was really really well and that's what allowed me to play such good golf it followed into this week in the past i've gotten frustrated in the u s open i've made a lot of birdies and a ton of bogeys and double bogeys and i was able to kind of switch it up this week and actually made more birdies than bogeys and get it done,0
jon rahm,1,2021-06,2021,187,1,0,1,now that you're at this point can you describe what the process has been like of getting your temperament to match your talent,i've said it before i know it's hard to believe but there's been a steady progress like everything in life is setbacks but i feel like from the setbacks some good moments have come i believe becoming a dad was always going to help me because before i could always have the excuse that getting mad helped me out helped me win golf tournaments but right now i'm a role model to my son i'm going to be as i am to many kids out there now i understand what i can do and i know i can perform at my best without showing my frustration so much i made that deal with myself after the third round of the pga i wasn't happy with how i ended and i could have handled it better and i vowed to myself to be a better role model for my son he won't remember any of this because he's only ten weeks old but i do hopefully in the future he can grow up to be someone who's proud of his dad i hope i can provide that example,0
jon rahm,1,2021-06,2021,215,1,0,1,take us back to saturday night at the memorial you had a six shot lead looked like you were on your way to winning again on the pga tour what have the last few weeks been like for you,this is the power of positive thinking i was never resentful for one second for what happened and i don't blame anybody it's been a difficult year and unfortunately covid is a reality in this world and it's affected a lot of people i got out of what happened the best possible hand because nobody in my family got sick i barely got any symptoms i have to mention we have lost a lot of people back home we have lost some friends this one is to a friend of mine who was a journalist who had just started getting into golf and he was basically following me around the world of golf and when he started he had no idea what golf was and he passed away a few months ago from covid it was very quick from the time he got it he went to the icu and passed away like him there's many people in this world i know what happened a couple of weeks ago some people might say it wasn't fair but it was what had to be done we still have to be aware of what's going on in this world take care of yourself and everybody around you so we can get over this as quick as possible,0
jon rahm,1,2021-06,2021,134,1,0,1,you talk about this being a special place you won your first ever pga tour event here you asked your now wife kelley to marry you here on the cliffs at torrey pines and now you've won a u s open here what does this property mean to you,i've said it once i've said it a million times and i'm going to say it once again it reminds me a lot of back home it's not exactly the same but the coastline the weather the property this is basically a good summer day where i grew up and these poa annua greens is something i know and i understand and i grew up on and i think it's something that really resonates with me i'm really confident in it like we just said everything that's happened here i don't know why but every time we come here we're just happy as soon as we land in san diego it's like we are in our spot again once again we were in our spot and i was able to come out on top,0
jon rahm,1,2021-06,2021,92,1,0,1,what was the date you got vaccinated,i don't know not early enough that's all i can say looking back on it yeah i guess i wish i would have done it earlier but thinking on scheduling purposes and having the pga and defending memorial i was just to be honest it wasn't in my mind i'm not going to lie i was trying to just get ready for a golf tournament if i had done it in a few days earlier probably we wouldn't be having these conversations right now it is what it is we move on,0
jon rahm,1,2021-06,2021,213,1,0,1,this was obviously a big deal to you but there was a real firestorm throughout the country on this people were upset for you they were upset about the rule they were upset with how it was handled were you aware of all that that was going on what a big deal this became,i mean i tried to hide as much as possible but i think nowadays it's impossible so yeah i was aware of what was going on and to all the people criticizing the pga tour they shouldn't we are in a pandemic and even though this virus has very different forms of attacking people you never know what reaction you're going to get so pga tour did what they had to do the cdc rules for a reason there's players that missed the world series last year there's other athletes that have missed events unfortunately i had a really good showing and i was pulled out of the tournament right before the final round but again the pga tour did what they had to do i've heard a lot of different theories i should have played alone i shouldn't have that's nonsense the rules are there and it's clear i'm not going to lie i was fully aware when i was in tracing protocol that that was a possibility i knew that could happen i was hoping it wouldn't i was playing like it's not going to but i support what the pga tour did it could have been handled a little bit better possibly but they did what they had to do,0
jon rahm,1,2021-06,2021,209,0,1,1,i was going to ask you that were you okay with you being told as you came right off the green,well i'm not going to lie that's the second time i get put on the spot on national tv on the same golf course on the same hole laughter for all those people wondering when i said not again that's exactly what i mean not again last year i put my heart out talking about one of my family members passing and i get told well go sign your scorecard with a penalty stroke with no warning then this past year i put arguably the best performance of my life and i get told again on live tv hey you're not playing tomorrow so it could have been handled a little bit better yeah but it still doesn't change the fact of what really happened because it was the second time i got put on the spot on the same course why i was a little bit more hurt but yeah again it's tough they don't want me to go by and start shaking all the patrons' hands and high fiving and all that so i understand that as well again it happened luckily everybody in my family and myself are okay luckily i didn't really have any symptoms and within what happened this is the best case scenario,0
jon rahm,1,2021-06,2021,116,0,1,1,the tour said at the time they were discussing your issue that a little north of percent of players on tour have been vaccinated what would you say to those other percent that have not,i mean we live in a free country so do as you please i can tell you from experience that if something happens you're going to have to live with the consequences golf wise now again the country is going at a great pace of getting vaccinated if we want to go back to having a normal life and normal tour events and try to go back to normality as early as possible people should get vaccinated i know if you're younger you run less of a risk of having big problems from covid but truthfully we don't know the long term effects of this virus so i would encourage people to actually get it done,0
jon rahm,1,2021-06,2021,96,1,0,1,and those negatives didn't come for almost hours you had to take it thursday and didn't get the result until friday,yeah well that's obviously pretty quick we're used to the pga tour having the lab and within two hours you get your test but when you're hiring other third parties luckily we found a doctor that could come to the house and i wouldn't have to drive and compromise anybody that was pretty quick once i got my first negative and i got my test done on friday i was like you'd better hurry this up i want to know tonight i still found out the next morning they can only do what they can do,0
jon rahm,1,2021-06,2021,264,0,1,1,yeah,yeah yeah just in my case i had nothing but support out here in dublin ohio so it was great i mean yeah it happens it is what it is i mean it's part of sports it's only unfortunate that sometimes fans go a little bit too far and we can't do anything about it i think the only unfortunate part but it's i think with sports and it's happening more and more is that we athletes are held to a certain standard and the fans are not for a fan to get kicked out they have to say something really bad and if we do anything towards them we get fined right away so i think there has to be a balance and it's going to keep happening in golf with the whole draftkings and betting live going on i caught a couple times yesterday where seeing one of my playing partners miss a putt and see people just exchanging cash right next to the green it just happens yeah i and you see it more and more it's part of what it is it's almost like people are in a bar doing the same thing right so it's going to happen i think as players we need to do our part to try our best to not get affected by it but i also think that the tour needs to at some point also protect the players i have no idea what happened yesterday i don't know how bad it was but i know people can say some bad stuff out there,0
jon rahm,1,2021-06,2021,437,1,1,1,you were one of the guys who were waiting on phil after he won the pga a couple weeks ago just curious what you were thinking as that was unfolding and is there anything about him now that you sort of admire for being able to pull that off given his struggles of late last year or year and a half,i love phil he's been a great mentor to me and the mickelson family is very close to me they mean a lot i'm not going to lie with how windy it was out there and towards the end all i could say is i cannot believe he's going to pull this off like i don't know if i told him this but i will tell him straight up if i would tell you like the last person i would put money on to win that week phil would be one of those it would be down there just because of how long it is how many drivers you need to hit and how windy it is now at the same time i'm going to say i played with him on monday and he had a new driver that he was hitting really well it was much more under control and after monday i could believe him putting on a good performance but he hadn't been playing great golf and but that shows you the greatness of a great champion it doesn't matter when he got himself in that position after holes it was gold good old phil he got it going at one point he had a big lead and both saturday and sunday he was able to create a lead and defend it so it's unbelievable i really admire and i think i've said it before in an interview that at the age of he's been playing on the pga tour for as long or longer than i've been alive he still has that enthusiasm and that drive to become better and beat the best and at his age simply it hadn't happened you had a couple years where like tom watson and greg norman went to the open and had a chance which i do believe the open would be the one event for somebody who is older to be able to win because you can think your way around the golf course that place with how long it was at the age of for phil to be able to do what he did it's unbelievable playing with him a lot knowing how he analyzes every shot and how he's trying to get better and the changes he made in his life to be healthier and be able to still grind like he does i mean again i hope that in plus years i still have the same enthusiasm and the same grit to become better and it's a mark of great champions and that's the reason why he's had the career he's had,0
jon rahm,1,2021-06,2021,164,1,0,1,does his ability to needle and give guys grief give him an advantage when he's playing in one of those matches like he's going to do with bryson and tom brady and those guys,it's a very filtered version of what i hear usually when i'm playing with him i'm going to tell you that it's very different he can get a lot funnier than that but obviously on public tv at prime time you can't be saying certain things in those instances no i don't think it's going to be a factor now knowing that bryson has won the one open or the one major that phil hasn't i feel like bryson could push that on him but i'm sure he'll mention the pga he'll mention the green jackets he'll mention something he'll for sure will try to get under his skin a little bit but i don't think in that match it's going to make much of a difference now when we're playing in private without cameras and without people he does get pretty funny but we all know who he is and how he is right so it's not like it really affects our play,0
jon rahm,1,2021-05,2021,218,1,1,1,what can you tell us about phil he's somebody that took you under his wing he's been a reference for you,yeah it's incredible what he's doing at years of age i don't know exactly where it is to be leading the pga after holes in what may not be the most phil like golf course you need to drive it really well out here and it's long he's doing an unbelievable job i played with him on the practice round and i could tell he was playing great and we all know what he's capable of but the fact that at his age it hasn't been done it would be unbelievable he's been very close many times to win majors and one could say that five may not be enough to how good of a career he's had and i really hope he gets his record i hope he gets his win i hope he gets to put that stamp in history that would not be beaten in a very long time his enthusiasm is what keeps him going at his age has the same enthusiasm i have at and he's been doing this a very long time i mean he's been on tour as long as i've been alive for him to keep that willingness to play and compete and practice even when he hasn't been working it's truly admirable so i hope he gets it done,0
jon rahm,1,2021-05,2021,275,1,0,1,you are one of the few golfers who were involved in the collaboration with the lpga and michelle wie and the hoodie for golf i'm curious how that came to be and how you see how important it is to have those type of cross collaborations between the pga and lpga tours,to be honest i'm not on social media all that much actually i don't have it on any of the social media platforms on my phone i was told about it right before i made the video and seemed like a no brainer to support the cause i was also told she pulled some strings and some of the nba players are wearing that hoodie as well if i believe there's something going on in many other sports as well right you see the male side supporting the females i've seen a lot of nba players wearing the jerseys from the female players from that same town i think i've seen a couple other times where i believe i forgot what it was more real madrid soccer players supported the real madrid female soccer players in some instances it's all for the growth of the game and i've said many times if i can do a little bit of what some players in the past did for the game outside of playing it would be an accomplished goal if you can just grow the game whether it's for males or females i think it's mission accomplished right and that's what we're here for we're not only just players we're ambassadors of the game and i think arnold jack tiger phil seve they all did a great job in that outside the golf course as well and some of them are still doing it i take it as a bit of a duty to be able to grow the game whether it's just for men or women obviously trying to include as many people as possible,0
jon rahm,1,2021-05,2021,193,1,0,1,yeah that's the one way to be exempt from mandatory military service is to win a medal at the olympics,well i would say if we're fighting for fourth and third place i'm open for bribing if he needs me to make a three putt on the last hole we can always talk about it i like korean food we can always talk about it that is very different right because he's going to be playing for just to be able to have a chance to be fulfilling his dream which is play golf on the pga tour it's not easy to do especially coming from a different country i feel for him that those are the two choices either win a medal or go military service because even if you end up in the nicest branch of the military it's still one or two years he can't play golf that's a big setback again i understand that's the rules and he probably knew it coming into it but he wouldn't be the first player to have to leave to go back to korea to do it right sang moon bae had to do it i feel for him yeah sang moon didn't have a chance to win an olympic medal did he,0
jon rahm,1,2021-05,2021,11,1,0,1,no they also had the asian games that was for amateurs if you had won a gold medal at the asian games you could've been exempt,i think they could include a pga tour event in that,0
jon rahm,1,2021-05,2021,18,1,0,1,no because when he was close at the masters in november they thought oh green jacket would get you out,they could include a pga tour event it's not like it's easy to win a pga tour event,0
jon rahm,1,2021-05,2021,127,1,0,1,MODERATOR,well i feel like i think it was after augusta with my son being born and me not having really taken a break in december i needed a week off so i decided not to play the week after new orleans and take that week fully off didn't touch a club for about eight days so i needed a couple weeks of prep before the pga so that's why i played last week and i'm playing this week as well now with that said as well i haven't played a couple events leading up to a major yet i've always taken a week or the two weeks after before off so try and see if i'm one of those players that needs to play the week before,0
jon rahm,1,2021-04,2021,263,0,1,1,MODERATOR,not much to what he said i'm not going to i think you might see some maybe some players that could be on that list or are on the edge over the years who maybe tried to use some of those criteria points to move or boost themselves up and into a higher position like myself i'm somebody who somewhat stays away from social media but now that knowing that social media it's a big part of one of five things that counts towards the ranking what i might try to start doing some things to maybe just boost the following a little bit to be honest i don't even know what the other points are i think social media is one of them google searchs is the other one it seems like for the most part if you play good golf things take care of themselves so social media is the one that you can kind of control right so you might see some people maybe more instagram lives or whatever it is or maybe lessons or q as or things like that so you might start seeing more involvement i'm pretty sure you'll definitely see more involvement on my part and i think it's a good thing because you don't necessarily have to be one of the top players in the world to have a chance right there's so many other ways to get around it and if you have a strong immediate presence you might be able to get there but i think obviously i think it's a great idea,0
jon rahm,1,2021-04,2021,130,1,0,1,first of all where did you go for dinner last night with coach payton,i just thought it was fun we don't get to play this format and actually count the strokes usually it's a match play in the ryder cup right that's the only time and growing up as a junior golfer in spain we have plenty of opportunities to play events like this one or play with a partner and i thought it's so unique it was the first i ever seen on the pga tour that it was fun obviously we both entered with different partners but it's something that's different it's appealing to me and it's you know you get to experience different things on the golf course you can rely on a partner you get people going double digits under par pretty easily it's just a really exciting week,0
jon rahm,1,2021-04,2021,84,0,1,1,when the baby was born did you know right away okay i'm going to wait until wednesday to come here,well she started delivery friday morning and they told us it could take a long time because she broke water first before even feeling contractions they told us that's the longest way and we were expecting her to deliver sometime saturday morning saturday afternoon it ended up being earlier but we couldn't be home earlier than sunday at noon and we had the first pediatrician appointment on tuesday so i was going to wait at least until tuesday morning that was always the plan,0
jon rahm,1,2021-04,2021,47,0,1,1,how long was the labor,when does labor start really because she broke her water broke at a m on friday and then she delivered at in the morning but again she didn't really feel contractions until maybe p m i would say official labor itself might have taken six seven hours,0
jon rahm,1,2021-03,2021,190,0,1,1,the whole issue of live mics on the course we have seen it catch jordan after he hits rory with his tee shot and obviously with justin how big an issue is that with you and the players and do you feel like you guys are being protected,no i just feel like maybe i'm asked more about certain sensitive subjects or more controversial subjects when i started i mean you're not going to ask everybody that just turned pro hey what do you think about this because you maybe don't have the experience now or maybe it's since i've been a high ranked player in the world for awhile i get asked more questions but i've always been confident with expressing my mind i have nothing to hide i'm a really honest person i hate lying so it wouldn't one thing you get from me is an honest straightforward answer and if it's a sensitive subject like maybe the last question was we'll just have to be careful on how to word it but i always try to express my mind i'm not a fake person i can't be a fake person i've just never been you can tell by my facial expressions on the golf course i can't hide what i'm thinking or feeling so you're always going to get a straightforward answer i've always been comfortable so it's just who i am in that sense,0
jon rahm,1,2021-03,2021,107,1,1,1,sounds like the players are pretty united on this subject as well don't you think,well yeah exactly i feel like the more of these i've done the better i've played i feel like it gets to a point where maybe people want to know what i think about certain subjects maybe some things affect me more than others because when you're on pga tour live week after week some things might affect you more than others like the last question that when i started on tour when i was never one of those feature groups so maybe it's just i don't know i'm comfortable with who i am and with my thoughts and my beliefs so you'll get a straightforward answer,0
jon rahm,1,2021-03,2021,240,0,1,1,this week the tour is returning with the every shot live technology where every shot from every player is going to be available for consumption a big driver in that seems to be the increased prominence of betting within the sport that's something that the tour has embraced i want to get your thoughts on the increased prominence of betting in golf where it's potentially influencing how fans are consuming the sport,well listen there's been a lot of people live always betting you can hear it they bet for anything and you can hear it some people are looking for you missing that putt and some people are looking for you making the putt it goes on we hear it a lot less than what it actually goes on it hasn't really changed the golf crowd i would say as much i'm not really particularly paying attention to what the crowd is doing all day but yeah i do believe that the live betting is it's just another way of keeping people engaged i understand not everybody watching golf is a fan of every single player out there right and if you're watching a sport and you want to somehow stay engaged betting is a great way to do it it's something that's unavoidable it's been going on worldwide with every single sport so why not it's another element that makes it more exciting and when it comes down to a sunday afternoon the last few holes everybody is investing in who's going to win at that point there's a lot of people out there that have bets already it's only going to help make it more exciting on those thursday friday maybe morning rounds where the views are not as high as they could be if you're in the final group sunday would that raise any safety concerns for you,0
jon rahm,1,2021-02,2021,149,0,1,1,despite the bogey on the last hole a decent day how would you assess it out there,you know the bogey just makes it feel so much worse than it really is to be honest i was under bogey free through without having my best i scrambled early on pretty good made the long putt on for bonus and that front nine i made a under and could have been a lot worse back nine i played a little bit better could have maybe made a putt on for eagle that would've been better and maybe if i put it on dry land but still great up and down on two putt on just too bad on that first putt was slow and then the second one i live here enough to know that valley pull is a thing and you know played it there and it just wasn't there overall you know with what's by far not my a game was a pretty good round,0
jon rahm,1,2021-02,2021,141,1,0,1,MODERATOR,well first of all it's a home event get to sleep in my own bed so it's nice the traveling is not too much especially coming from san diego a lot of good memories obviously my first cut made on the pga tour was here had a great finish as an amateur and the whole sun devil vibe and just the familiarity with everything i love the event love the fans i'm glad we can have at least a day makes a big difference out there and even today right it's just great to see all the smiling faces of the kids the fans it was great to be out there looking forward to it hopefully i've been able to have a lot of good rounds out here hopefully i can put a good weekend together and get the first win,0
jon rahm,1,2021-02,2021,153,1,0,1,sports betting is becoming more and more common in this country more states are legalizing sports betting how do you see the pros and cons of more and more sports betting affecting what you do and affecting the pga tour,i mean somebody having on me making or missing the putt is not going to affect what i do i can tell you that i'm pretty sure most of us players have a lot more on the line by making or missing a putt it's not what i'm thinking about it's something that's been going on since i was a pro it's been going on for a long time a lot of times you hear fans and they'll bet between each other i mean it's part of the culture i would say everywhere i'm a person that didn't grow up betting on sports but it's becoming bigger and spain bigger in europe it's already big here it's part of the entertainment as well again i don't know much about it but i mean i don't have a problem with it fans got to do what they've got to do to enjoy the day,0
jon rahm,1,2021-01,2021,228,0,1,1,final thing if you can reflect on the change of equipment and getting used to it in competition i know a lot of our listeners when they get new clubs it probably takes them half a season to get used to the numbers on their golf course but for a professional how long does it take you to get accustomed to how they're going to perform in competition,well what people might not know is i basically got fitted and did a lot of work quite earlier than they thought than people would think so i already had a valuable set of clubs for after augusta and then as soon as augusta was done i didn't take any time off i went straight to san diego and spent three days a lot of hours in the callaway center hitting a lot of shots just making sure everything's dialed in and when i went home i was really confident with everything the only thing for me was going to be what clubs i put into play and i did not expect that the only one not being callaway was going to be the putter but i'm still adjusting to it i think the biggest thing to get used to is the golf ball one thing is hitting shots at home and the other one is hitting shots here i live in arizona not much air density everything looks pretty straight come here to hawaii humid and windy i have to get used to how the ball reacts in the wind and i think that's what a lot of yesterday was and it's still going to take a little bit of getting used to but based on today and how i'm playing i would say i'm pretty close,0
jon rahm,1,2020-11,2020,509,1,0,1,MODERATOR,i didn't mention anything about health in spanish i mentioned other things but i can tell you since we started since we restarted the season my life has basically been i'm going to say bedroom because it's either my house a rental home or hotel from the bedroom to the golf course to the gym maybe to the gym to the airport maybe to that i've either been in a room airport or a golf course and that's it i mean barely gone out to any restaurants and only if we are back home and we know we can make it safe haven't really seen that many friends and even when i go play you know i have my own cart back home and i don't allow anybody in my cart and i try to really stay away from everybody i use my own towel don't really even get close to anybody on the tee box or anything like that not going to great lengths not only because of me because i think it's each person's duty to do our best part to not spread this right so i'm going to do my part in case i get something to not get anybody else infected and try to do my part to not spread it i always try to think about how i would likeâ€‘â€‘ you know how i would like myself to be treated in that sense and i wouldn't like especially the other people in my family to get it so i'm always selfâ€‘conscious about other people as well you never know what can happen but i try to be careful luckily nobody in my family in spain and nobody in my family here has gotten it and let's hope it stays that way even though in spain they are going through a bit more severe of a time they're not on lockdown right now but they do have a curfew restaurants are closed and they can't even leave their zip code right now so things are a little more serious over there right now than here let's hope it get better soon and everybody can resume life as well as possible but with all that said i think you know everybody here and by everybody i mean golfers we are all thankful to actually be able to be here and see to what great lengths the pga tour and other governing bodies of golf and augusta national and everybody else has gone to make this possible everybody involved in golf especially the players i'm going to say have done a great job because we haven't had that many positives compared to other sports we are traveling more than anybody else it's the hardest bubble to keep together because we all are individuals and you know we have rarely seen cases i think that's what makes itâ€‘â€‘ you know it's a good point that we are making that if you actually take care of things and do what you're supposed to do you actually somewhat control this,0
